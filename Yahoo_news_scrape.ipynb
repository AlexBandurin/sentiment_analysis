       "  'Mixed martial arts enthusiast Mark Zuckerberg is taking the gloves off, only this time instead of social media rival Elon Musk, he’s gunning for Tim Cook.In a\\xa0video post\\xa0to his account on Meta’s Instagram, the company founder took his best shot at the Apple CEO’s new Vision Pro, after the mixed reality headset stole the thunder away from Zuckerberg’s $500 Quest 3 launched just\\xa0four months prior.“I expected that Quest would be the better value for most people, since it’s really good and it’s seven times less expensive,” the Meta boss said on Tuesday after revealing he just tried out Cook’s $3,500 device.“But after using it, I don’t just think that Quest is the better value—I think that Quest is the better product, period.”Zuckerberg, the fourth wealthiest entrepreneur in the world, just celebrated Meta’s single-day $200 billion gain in market value, the largest for any company on record, after posting stronger-than-expected Q4 results and news of its first-ever dividend.Yet there was one blight in the earnings report: his company’s Reality Labs division responsible for Quest.Not only did it post a loss of nearly $4.7 billion, an all-time high for a single quarter, it crossed the staggering mark of $42 billion in cumulative red ink to date.Investors have since been pleading with Meta to end the constant destruction of shareholder value.That’s in part because virtual reality headsets have simply struggled to gain a broader audience, despite the efforts of Zuckerberg and rival Sony.Users frequently complain the bulky contraptions prove uncomfortable to wear for long periods, trigger nauseating bouts of motion sickness and lack compelling content.I prefer this … pic.twitter.com/kYzNrXktjm— Robin Holland (@rnholl) February 4, 2024The Quest 3 was supposed to address many of the shortcomings, including a slimmer design that is lighter in the front and a full-color passthrough so users can at all times navigate their physical environment with the headset on.But ever since Cook launched his VisionPro earlier this month, which the Apple CEO deliberately branded a “spatial computer” (rather than a mixed reality headset), sentiment has shifted considerably.The internet lit up with all manner of pictures, videos and memes both praising Apple’s first all-new hardware device in years, as well as poking fun at those wearing it.For once, though, people are at least talking about the technology.“Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created,” boasted\\xa0Cook, claiming it would “redefine how we connect, create and explore.”In Zuckerberg’s Instagram video—recorded using the Quest 3—the Meta CEO countered his device was in key aspects superior to Apple’s.Not only did he point out it came with precision handheld controllers and lacked cables that can be a nuisance, Zuckerberg claimed it was simply more comfortable.“I was surprised by how many trade-offs they had to make to the quality of the device, to the comfort and ergonomics,” he said. “Overall Quest is better for the vast majority of things that people use mixed reality for.”Whether Zuckerberg’s return salvo will land with consumers remains to be seen.But if Apple begins to release sales figures for the Vision Pro, it could be good news for Meta investors as it might finally shame Meta into publishing more statistics around demand for the Quest 3.Needless to say, there will be plenty of entertainment to come in what has been aptly dubbed the “Nerd Goggle Wars”.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com'],\n",

       "  \"The American economy has a rich history of creating the world's most valuable companies over the past century even though its leading industries are constantly changing:United States Steel became the world's first $1 billion company in 1901.General Motors rode the automotive boom to become the world's first $50 billion company in 1955.The power of conglomerates was on full display when General Electric became the first-ever $100 billion company in 1995.By 2018, the technology sector reigned supreme, and Apple hit the most impressive milestone of all: a $1 trillion valuation.Apple is a $2.9 trillion company today, but it recently lost its status as the world's largest company to Microsoft, which is worth a shade over $3 trillion. Since 2018, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Meta Platforms have also surpassed $1 trillion valuations.There might be one more company set to join that exclusive club. Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) is the world's largest provider of ride-hailing services, and it's preparing for a shift to autonomous vehicles that could transform the company's economics.Uber is worth $146 billion as of this writing, so a rise to $1 trillion would translate to a gain of 680% in its stock price. Here's why I think it could happen within 10 years.Uber's core business is ride-hailing (mobility), but it took a dive during the pandemic when the economy ground to a halt. The company's delivery platform, led by UberEats, successfully picked up the slack during that period, and it continues to grow.But midway through 2023, the mobility segment officially surpassed delivery to once again become its primary source of gross bookings. That momentum continued throughout the year, and in the fourth quarter (ended Dec. 31), the mobility segment logged a record-high $19.3 billion in gross bookings. It represented 28% year-over-year growth, far outpacing the 17% growth of the delivery business.Throughout 2023, Uber's 150 million monthly platform customers booked over 9.4 billion trips across mobility, delivery, and the company's newer commercial freight segment. Total gross bookings were $137.8 billion for the year, and they were made possible by 6.8 million drivers working within the Uber ecosystem. Each number I just cited represents a record high.Management focused heavily on optimization last year, which involved cost cuts. It was a departure from the growth-at-all-costs posture the company had maintained since it was founded, and the shift led to the first profitable year in its history. It had a 2023 net income of almost $1.9 billion, which was a huge swing from the $9.1 billion net loss it generated in 2022.The 6.8 million drivers in Uber's ecosystem are by far the company's largest cost. A total of $62 billion of the $137.8 billion in gross bookings was paid to drivers in 2023. After deducting the money paid to restaurants, grocery stores, and various partners as part of customer orders, total bookings translated to $37.2 billion in revenue for the year and nearly $1.9 billion in profit.Uber is preparing for a shift to self-driving cars and trucks, which could significantly reduce its costs. The company now has 10 autonomous partnerships across all segments, and as of the fourth quarter, tens of thousands of autonomous rides had already been completed.The company signed a 10-year deal in 2022 with Motional, a leading autonomous-vehicle joint venture between mobility technology company Aptiv and Korean automaker\\xa0Hyundai. Motional has already developed an autonomous platform using Hyundai's Ioniq 5 electric vehicle as a base, and Uber will bring its 150 million monthly platform customers to the table to accelerate adoption.It also has a partnership with Alphabet's self-driving subsidiary, Waymo, which is already live and working in Phoenix, Arizona. In December, the company also unveiled a new partnership with Torc (owned by Mercedes-Benz), which will use data from the Uber Freight platform to accelerate the development of autonomous trucks.On top of those partnerships, Uber owns a 21% direct equity stake in Aurora, which acquired Uber's in-house self-driving division in 2020 and has continued to develop its technology. It also owns a 4% stake in mobility company Joby Aviation, which is developing autonomous aerial vehicles.Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management thinks autonomous ride-hailing alone will create $14 trillion in enterprise value for companies and generate $4 trillion in revenue by 2028. Uber already has a 25% global market share in traditional ride-sharing, and its autonomous partnerships could make it a leader in the driverless segment, too.But let's set that aside for a moment. Based on Uber's $37.2 billion in 2023 revenue and the company's current valuation of $146 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.9.If that P/S multiple remains constant, Uber will have to reach $256.4 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation. It could hit the mark within 10 years if its revenue grows at a compound annual rate of 21.3% between now and then.Revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 29.4% since 2017, which is comfortably above where it needs to be, and that's without a meaningful contribution from autonomous ride-hailing.That rate will be extremely difficult to sustain even over the next few years because the business is so large now. But Ark Invest's forecast could change the equation entirely if it proves correct. Uber could capture $1 trillion worth of revenue from its autonomous ride-hailing between now and 2028 alone, assuming its existing market share in traditional ride-hailing remains constant.That alone will warrant a valuation well beyond $1 trillion – and it doesn't include innovations in autonomous delivery or freight.I will caution investors that Ark's forecasts might be on the ambitious side. However, Uber isn't the only company that has spotted this opportunity. Tesla is gearing up to launch its own autonomous driving software, and CEO Elon Musk intends to build a ride-sharing network so its vehicle owners can earn extra income when they aren't using their cars.Even if autonomous technologies don't take off as quickly as Ark predicts, it's clear that's where the industry is headed, and I think it will open up a path for Uber to become a $1 trillion company within the next decade.Should you invest $1,000 in Uber Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Uber Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Uber Technologies wasn’t one of them.

       "  \"Got some extra cash you won't be needing anytime soon, but don't know what to do with it? Maybe you just don't have time to ferret out your portfolio's next pick? Whatever the case, there's a simple solution -- borrow an idea from one of the world's most proven investors, Warren Buffett. Or, more specifically, buy one of the names Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway already owns.Here's a rundown of three Buffett-approved picks Berkshire Hathaway is currently holding that would also be at home in most investors' portfolios.To say Coca-Cola\\xa0(NYSE: KO) is a well-known brand somehow seems like a serious understatement. It's a market-share leader, domestically as well as internationally. Indeed, now well over 100 years old, the company's become a cultural icon.It's not just its namesake cola anymore, of course. The Coca-Cola Company is also parent to Dasani water, Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Powerade sports drink, and Sprite just to name a few of its other beverage brands. This wide range of products is a big reason Coca-Cola's been able to maintain its revenue and earnings growth for so long even though the beverage marketplace is constantly evolving. (Namely, consumers are drinking less sugary soda and drinking more water and tea.) It's always got something to sell someone.More important to investors, this steady flow of sales and profits is why the company's dividend history is nothing less than stellar. Not only has Coca-Cola been reliably paying dividends every year for decades, but it's also raised its dividend payment every year for the past 61 years. Only nine other companies in existence today boast a longer track record of annual dividend growth.Don't look for any dividend disruption anytime soon either. Aside from being one of the world's most memorable, loyalty-inspiring families of beverage brands, it's also earning more than enough to fund its current and future payouts. Only about two-thirds of its profits are paid out in the form of dividends. The difference provides a cushion against any fiscal turbulence and allows the company to reinvest in its relatively simple business's own growth.There was a time when Berkshire Hathaway simply wouldn't have owned a stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). See, for most of his stock-picking life, Buffett's steered clear of technology stocks, explaining he doesn't invest in companies he doesn't fully understand. That's why Berkshire's 2016 purchase of Apple shares came as such a surprise.Even more surprising is that Buffett has added to the trade in the meantime, as Apple's stock price has grown. The 915 million-share holding is not only about 5% of Apple itself, but now also accounts for roughly half of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio. That's a lot by both measures.The decision probably wasn't all Buffett's. Younger managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler arguably better understand Apple's strengths and weaknesses, and as such were in a better position to suggest the pick.That being said, it's not as if the position is misaligned with Buffett's usual stock-selection regimen, nor is it out of place within the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. The company's business is actually quite easy to understand, for example -- Apple makes smartphones, and supports their sales by providing a robust ecosystem of apps that extract every ounce of functionality from the device.There's another detail about Apple, however, that that arguably even better qualifies it as a Buffett pick. That is, it's a strong business with clear competitive advantages. Underscoring this claim are numbers from market research outfit Bionic, which reports 92.6% of iPhone users intend to buy another one in the future while only 74.6% of current Android smartphone users say they'll buy another Android phone when the time comes. Meanwhile, mobile app consultant Asymco's Horace Dediu says iPhone users spend on the order of 7 times more on apps and digital content than Android users do. That's a clear, significant edge.Last but not last, add Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to consider if you've got a few extra thousand bucks to work with at this time. Berkshire Hathaway's holding a little over 1 billion shares of the megabank right now, making it the fund's second-biggest holding.Boring? A little. But that's kind of the point. Owning stocks as a form of entertainment can often work against you. Like Buffett, you want to hold stocks that dish out superior long-term rewards without a bunch of drama in the short run. BofA does exactly that.OK, there's been one exception to this reliable progress. That's the stock's sizable pullback in 2008 following the subprime mortgage meltdown.Like so many other banking stocks around that time, this one was riding high on a movement that would eventually -- and abruptly -- be undermined. In fact, Bank of America shares have yet to reclaim their 2006 high. That's mostly because abnormally low interest rates in the meantime have crimped lending's profit margin rates.That collapse and the subsequent several years' worth of low interest rates are the exception to the norm, however. Things are easing back to normal now. And, having remembered the harsh lessons taught by 2008's mortgage market collapse, it's unlikely BofA is going to put itself in a similar situation again in the near future.The real appeal to investors here, however, is the dividend. Bank of America shares' current dividend yield stands at a healthy 2.9%, based on a quarterly payment that's grown from $0.12 per share in 2017 (when the banking industry finally and fully shook off the impact of 2008's nightmare) to $0.24 per share now. That's a compound annual growth rate of more 9%, far outpacing inflation's growth during that stretch. And that doesn't even count the stock's price growth of 40% during that pandemic-mired turbulent period.Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

       "  '(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s longest-serving senior industrial designer is leaving the company, marking the near-complete turnover of a team once led by Jony Ive.Most Read from BloombergThe Brutal Reality of Plunging Office Values Is HereWall Street Regains Footing After CPI-Fueled Rout: Markets WrapMusk Says Putin Can’t Lose in Ukraine, Opposes Senate BillDemocrat Suozzi Wins Back NY House Seat Vacated by SantosA ‘Clerical Error’ in Lyft Outlook Triggered 67% JumpBart Andre, who joined Apple in 1992 alongside Ive, told colleagues this month that he is retiring, according to people familiar with the matter. Andre was one of the last remaining designers from the Ive era and helped create the aesthetic for Apple products released over the past three decades — even prior to Steve Jobs returning to the helm in the late 1990s.The designer was known as one of Ive’s top lieutenants and helped run the team after former chief Evans Hankey, Ive’s successor, departed last year. He’s also known as one of the biggest holders of Apple patents.“His mark on Apple products is indelible — I see him every day in the details,” said Christopher Stringer, who used to work with Andre at Apple and now runs sound company Syng.The departure is the latest in recent months for the group. Top designers Colin Burns, Shota Aoyagi and Peter Russell-Clarke all left around the end of last year. Multiple longtime designers on Apple’s software design team have also signaled they are planning to leave in the near future.Both the industrial-design and user-interface groups are overseen by Jeff Williams, the company’s chief operating officer. He’s held that role since Ive’s departure in 2019 but took on direct management of the industrial-design team last year when Hankey left.Having an operations person oversee a division dedicated to design and innovation has rankled some staff, according to the people close to the situation. There have also been cost-cutting measures that have added to the unrest, they said. Under Ive, the team embarked on exploratory projects that didn’t necessarily have an immediate payoff — something that’s been reined in.Apple, based in Cupertino, California, didn’t respond to a request for comment.Ive’s core design team was made up of about two dozen people for well over a decade. Around the time Ive left in 2019, an exodus began. Nearly all of the senior designers who reported directly to Ive have now left. Many of them joined LoveFrom, a design firm founded by Ive that worked with Apple until two years ago.The industrial-design team has been replenished with new outside talent, but there are few longtime members remaining who worked under Ive and helped create hit products like the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Richard Howarth, who serves as vice president of design, is a carryover from the Ive era, along with Molly Anderson and Duncan Kerr.Since Hankey’s departure, the most senior designers have led the team’s day-to-day operations, working alongside Williams. The operating chief was picked to manage the group, in part, so that he could better coordinate with the manufacturing team. There also was a lack of other viable options to replace Hankey.Read More: Apple’s Brain Drain Hinders Efforts to Pick Its Next Jony IveThe Apple design team is tasked with devising the look and feel of devices and software, as well as developing new features and interfaces. That includes minute details like the sound of ringtones and alerts from an iPhone.The group was central to the creation of the company’s last two product categories, the Apple Watch and Vision Pro. The watch’s design was spearheaded by Ive, who also helped craft the iMac, iPod and iPhone. Though the Vision Pro began development during his tenure, he left years before it was released.(Updates with more on team’s history starting in seventh paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat’s Really Behind Tesla’s SlowdownAdobe’s Very Cautious Gambit to Inject AI Into EverythingThe US Will Face Blowback in the Middle East, No Matter WhatCan I Hire My Crush?It’s Not Love Generating Those Dating Reality Shows.

       "  \"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the most influential companies in history.The iPhone heralded the era of the mobile internet, and now, the Vision Pro may kick off the next major computing platform. Most of the credit for the company's success is usually given to co-founder and longtime CEO Steve Jobs. He led Apple through its most inventive period when it released the iPod, iPhone, and iPad in less than a decade, setting the stock on an incredible growth path that's lasted to this day.Current CEO Tim Cook took the helm in Aug. 2011, shortly before Jobs' death. Cook had previously served as Chief Operating Officer, running the company's sales operation and supply chain. While some were skeptical that Cook could fill Jobs' shoes, he's skillfully led Apple and its stock to new heights. Here's how the company has fared during his tenure.In 2011, the tech industry was much smaller than it is today. Smartphones were still relatively new, and the mobile economy was just developing.True to expectations, Apple's pace of innovation has slowed under Cook. Prior to the release of the Vision Pro earlier this month, the biggest products launched under his tenure have been accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods.Cook's biggest accomplishments have likely been the growth of the company's installed base of devices, which reached 2.2 billion in its most recent quarter, and the growth of the services business. Services generate significantly higher margins than Apple's devices, and annual services revenue exploded from $12.9 billion in fiscal 2012 to $85.2 billion in fiscal 2023. Revenue from this segment is largely driven by the App Store, or the 30% commission Apple takes on in-app payments, as well as offerings like Apple Pay and Apple Care insurance.These achievements have largely been incremental: Improving each iteration of the iPhone enough to keep customers coming back for an upgrade, helping to grow the services business, and selling complementary devices like Apple Watches and Airpods.However, 2024 has set the stage for arguably the biggest risk the company has taken under Cook: the release of the Vision Pro. Though reviews have been mixed, most industry observers believe that if any company can crack the headset market, it's Apple.As most investors know, Apple has been a big winner in the Cook era.As you can see, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin since Cook took over in Aug. 2011 -- up 1,270% (or 1,530% on a total return basis). That means an investor who bought $10,000 of Apple stock at the start of Cook's tenure would have $163,000 today after enjoying a compound annual return of 25%. An equal investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $52,100 today.Apple held the title of the world's most valuable company for most of the past several years, but it recently lost the crown to longtime rival Microsoft. Nonetheless, Apple is still in good shape to deliver solid profit growth as it grows services revenue, repurchases stock, and refreshes its device lineup.The company dominates the consumer tech industry, and it's grown its share of the smartphone market in recent years.While the stock commands premium to the broad market with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, Apple has proven itself time and again, and its core businesses look as strong as ever. Cook teased a generative AI announcement for later this year, which could be transformative for the company. And the Vision Pro, if successful, could reshape Cook's legacy as an innovator.Maintaining a pace of 25% average annual returns might be difficult, but the company is still well-positioned to outperform the market for the foreseeable future.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

       "  \"In this piece, we will take a look at 11 stocks that might be splitting soon. If you want to skip our overview of what a stock split is and some recent stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon. When it comes to keeping investors happy, publicly traded stock managers have several options at their disposal. When it comes to investor expectations, the management strategy depends on the kind of stock. For value stocks, i.e. companies that seek to deliver share price and business stability by targeting well established markets, investors typically hope for dividends and the ability to hedge losses and growth drops during turbulence. Similarly, for growth stocks, the primary driver is, well, growth - both for the earnings per share and the share price.One way in which a company can keep its share price stable over the long run and insulate it against sentiment driven volatility is by doing a stock split. A split, if you're unaware, is when a firm divides its shares into more shares. So a one for two split simply means that one share trading for $10 is now worth two shares worth $5 each and so on. The primary motivation for a stock split is management's aim to make the shares more tradeable, particularly for retail investors since a stock split makes the shares more affordable. Additionally, a stock split also increases liquidity, which makes for an overall healthier trading environment.Stock splits are quite common in the stock market and nearly every mega cap stock available for trading today has used them in its history. For instance, one of the most valuable companies in the world, the Cupertino, California consumer technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gone through five stock splits in its history. The most recent Apple stock split came in 2020 as the world was reeling from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Apple split a single share into four back then, and had the split not occurred and the shares had continued to appreciate by a similar percentage from then until now, then a single Apple share would currently be worth $744 right now. Apple's previous stock split before the 2020 split was a whopping 7 for 1 split in 2014, and cumulatively, as of February 2024, its shares have been divided into 168 components.Building on this, 2022 has been a busy year when it comes to mega cap stocks and stock splits. Big ticket names such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have all undergone stock splits which came right when the Federal Reserve was making preparations for lift off when it came to jacking up interest rates. Alphabet and Amazon both announced massive 20 for 1 stock splits in 2022, which was understandable since their shares were trading north of as much as $1,000 by then. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, market liquidity dries up and investors, both retail and institutional, find it hard to acquire capital to pile into stocks. Therefore, a stock split, which reduces the share price, encourages trading as a unit of a stock is now worth less in absolute dollar terms and can be bought relatively easily. Additionally, record share price gains during the coronavirus pandemic that saw investors flock to technology stocks due to their potential to capitalize from lock downs induced trend also pushed their share prices quite high and management thought it was best to bring it back to comfortable levels by splitting the shares.Fast forwarding to 2024, the year has borne some fruit when it comes to big companies and stock splits. The start of the year has seen the world's largest brick and mortar retailer Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announce a stock split. Walmart's shares have reclaimed their all time high levels in 2024 after the firm beat analyst Q4 2023 earnings per share estimates and kept the foot on the pedal when it comes to growth by announcing new stores in its biggest market, the U.S. The firm also announced a three for one stock split that is set to go into effect into February 2024. At the heart of the decision is associate well being, argues Walmart, with its official release sharing that the decision is motivated by ensuring an affordable entry level share price for its Associate Stock Purchase Plan.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some stocks that are splitting soon. Some notable names are Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Broadcom Inc.

       "  \"Even the largest companies on the planet face risks, and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is no exception. The consumer tech giant is currently grappling with difficulties on multiple fronts.When examining Apple, the most obvious risk is its business in China. After all, the company saw revenue from Greater China fall 13% in its most recent quarter.Since emerging from pandemic lockdowns, Chinese consumers have been cautious, and the Chinese economy has not been growing as quickly as expected. Meanwhile, with U.S.-China tensions heightened in recent years, some U.S. companies could be feeling the backlash as Chinese consumers turn to homegrown brands.On that front, Apple's iPhone is suddenly seeing stiff competition from Huawei, whose Mate 60 Pro smartphone has been a huge hit in China. Huawei and other Chinese companies previously had trouble getting the chips needed to provide 5G connectivity due to U.S. sanctions, which gave Apple a big competitive advantage in the region. However, Huawei has been able to develop its own 5G chip, which is being produced by Chinese semiconductor foundry SMIC. Other Chinese competitors like Xiaomi and Oppo have also introduced competing smartphones at cheaper prices.While China might appear to represent the largest threat to Apple's business model because Huawei is seizing share at the tech titan's expense, it's not the biggest risk. There are a lot of questions surrounding whether Huawei will be able to fulfill demand given 5G chip manufacturing issues. In fact, the company recently decided to slow smartphone production in order to focus on producing artificial intelligence (AI) chips. With Chinese competitors being limited by manufacturing troubles, Apple could vault back into the smartphone lead in the country if it can innovate.In the U.S., meanwhile, Apple is facing legal issues related to its App Store. Until recently, the iPhone maker made app developers use its payment system while collecting a 30% fee (or 15% for smaller developers) for all app or in-app purchases. However, Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, pushed back and sued the company, ultimately winning its case. But Apple mostly sidestepped the verdict, allowing app developers to use external payment systems, but charging a 27% commission (or 12% for small developers) just for using its platform.Earlier this month, a federal judge certified a class action lawsuit against Apple, allowing Apple account holders who have spent $10 or more in the App Store to sue the company over its policies leading to higher app prices.Additionally, Bloomberg has reported that the Department of Justice is preparing an antitrust case against the tech giant regarding alleged anticompetitive behavior. The news outlet said the lawsuit could come as early as March. While the case has not been announced yet, it does seem likely to center around the App Store's closed ecosystem and the commissions it charges.Apple's services business -- which includes the App Store -- is a key growth lever for the company. Services revenue increased 11% in the fiscal quarter ending in December. The segment also carries a much higher gross margin compared to its hardware division (approximately 73% versus 39%). Thus, any hit to this part of the business is a risk to Apple.But I don't think the threat here is as big as it might appear. Apple has already managed to sidestep one ruling, and app stores aren't unique in taking a commission when selling third-party products. Retail stores mark up prices; Roku takes a cut of subscriptions sold through its streaming TV operating system; and eBay charges a commission when items are sold through its auctions.While legal battles can be unpredictable, it could be a stretch to prove that Apple is hurting consumers with the App Store given that it is taking a commission that is less than the mark-up many retailers charge, as reflected in their gross margins. Kohl's and Macy's, for example, generally carry a gross margin of around 40%.While Apple has thus far been able to largely sidestep lowering App Store commissions in the U.S., it won't be so lucky in the European Union. As a result of the E.U.'s Digital Markets Act, Apple announced some major changes to both its Safari web browser and the App Store. Importantly, the company will reduce the fees it charges for purchases on its own platform, taking them from 30% (or 15% for small developers) to 17% (or 10% for small developers) in the E.U. starting in March. It will also now allow users to download apps from third-party app stores, from which it would get no commission.This change will directly impact the revenue that Apple generates from the App Store in the E.U. However, the E.U. App Store makes up only about 7% of Apple's overall App Store sales, so ultimately it is a small headwind that the company should be able to overcome in other areas. It's just not big enough to move the needle that much in either direction.But this all ties into what I think is actually the most important risk facing Apple, which is: It's not really playing offense anymore.Think about it -- Apple just hasn't been growing and innovating like it used to under former CEO Steve Jobs, and its stock multiple is not reflecting that risk. In fact, growth has been pretty lackluster recently. Revenue increased a scant 2% in its most recent fiscal quarter, and sales fell nearly 3% last fiscal year. Meanwhile, its price-to-earnings ratio has tripled since the end of 2011, the year of Jobs' death. Do you think that Apple's business should be worth 3 times the multiple it was in 2011? I don't.Especially because innovation has been lagging. While Apple's Pro Vision augmented reality headset has gotten some good initial buzz, it is not a mass-market product at this time given its $3,500 price tag. It is also the company's first major product category introduction since launching the Apple Watch nearly a decade ago. By contrast, Samsung has been quicker to incorporate new technologies and form factors, including foldable options, into its smartphones, while the iPhone has seen much more incremental improvements over the years.With generative AI now starting to transform the technology landscape, Apple could find itself playing catch-up and being ripe for disruption. Once at the forefront of tech innovation, Apple has just not shown itself to be the same innovative company it was in the past.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

However, queues did crop up at Apple Stores in Dubai, Australia, and China in September with people who didn’t pre-order an iPhone 15 online, according to Bloomberg.Apple\\'s large and loyal fan base makes it an ideal candidate to benefit from the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence, an opportunity investors may vastly undervalue.South China Morning Post/Getty ImagesApple posted\\xa0better-than-expected December quarter earnings earlier this month, but weak China sales and a muted iPhone revenue forecast marred the glad tidings.Now, the company appears to be gearing up to get in on the artificial intelligence firestorm that is burning up the tech sector.Related: Analyst reveals new Broadcom stock price target tied to AIIf Apple has its way, companies like OpenAI, Google, Nvidia, and Microsoft won\\'t be the only ones that profit from the AI tidal wave.During the Cupertino, Calif.-based company\\'s Feb 1. earnings call, CEO Tim Cook told analysts that AI \"is a major focus of ours.\"\"It\\'s incredible in terms of how it can enrich customers\\' lives,\" he said, citing the iPhone\\'s car crash and fall detection features and Apple Watch\\'s ECG app.\"I mean, these things have literally saved people\\'s lives,\" Cook said, according to a transcript of the call. \"And so we see an enormous potential in this space to affect virtually everything we do.\"\"It\\'s obviously a horizontal technology, not a vertical,\" he continued. \"And so it will affect every product in every service that we have.\"Bloomberg reported\\xa0in October that Apple was late to the AI shindig and is looking to add AI features like auto-summarizing and auto-complete to its core apps and productivity programs, such as Pages and Keynote.In addition, Apple is planning a major overhaul of Siri, the voice assistant that launched on the iPhone on Oct. 4, 2011- one day before Steve Jobs, the company\\'s co-founder, died.Analysts seemed awfully excited about Apple\\'s AI intentions--whatever they may be.Apple has not yet announced anything definitive on its Al strategy. Still, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani believes the company is \"an underappreciated Al beneficiary\" that stands to significantly benefit from integrating large language AI models, or LLMs, into its core technology.LLMs, including OpenAIs ChatGPT, which powers Microsoft\\'s Bing search engine, and Google\\'s Gemini, allow users to quickly search, parse, and create content.Daryanani told investors on Feb. 12 that Siri is the prime candidate for an LLM-driven upgrade, as the product currently lacks sufficient functionality, and a truly capable and reliable virtual assistant would be \"a game changer.\"The analyst, who maintains an\\xa0outperform rating and $220 price target on Apple shares, also believes that an LLM-enhanced iOS can add significant functionality to iPhone users.He\\'s not alone.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives also sees game-changing possibilities for the tech giant, comparing Apple\\'s AI endeavors to the most watched event in the world.More AI Stocks:AI wave takes this stock to record highs as investors look beyond Mag 7AI stock soars on new guidance (it\\'s not Nvidia!)Big tech stocks are doubling down on AI\"We believe the \\'Super Bowl moment for Apple\\' will be when Cook & Co. finally take the covers\\xa0off the generative AI technology being worked on in the labs of Apple Park,\" he \\xa0said, \"and introduces it to developers and consumers at WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) in June followed by\\xa0the exclusive AI features we expect to be included on iPhone 16.\"Ives, who has an outperform rating on Apple shares with a price target of $250, said in a research note that \"with now a\\xa0staggering 2.2 billion iOS active devices (up from about 2 billion a year ago), the game-changing monetization opportunity for Cupertino will be introducing a standalone\\xa0AI App Store to developers that lays the groundwork for Apple\\'s AI growth.\"\"We\\xa0believe the incremental revenue from services from Apple around AI could be $5\\xa0billion+ annually, and it\\'s just the start of this renaissance of growth at Apple,\" he told investors.And while the China demise narrative has been the black cloud over the Apple story, Ives said he is expecting iPhones \"to show year-over-year growth during the Lunar New Year in China. as some promotions and a stepped-up marketing campaign by Apple has been very successful in the mainland.\"\"Apple has a fight on its hands with (state-backed tech giant) Huawei and some geopolitical\\xa0headwinds,\" Ives said, \"but the reality is with over 200 million active iPhones in China, very few\\xa0consumers are switching out of the Apple ecosystem, and that is the linchpin to our\\xa0bullish thesis for Apple in China despite Street concerns.\"Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024'],\n",

       "  'In an alternate dimension, Apple Inc. might have absorbed Tesla Inc., a scenario contingent on a non-existent dialogue between the leaders of each company, Elon Musk and Tim Cook.During a critical juncture for Tesla, amidst its Model 3 production challenges, Elon Musk sought Apple’s intervention for a possible takeover, reflecting on this in a 2020 tweet highlighted by CNBC. This was a time marked by economic difficulties and production obstacles for the electric vehicle giant. Musk aimed to discuss Tesla’s acquisition with Cook in these “darkest days,” as he described them, yet Musk revealed that Cook refused the meeting. Looking back, Cook’s decision appears to be a decisive turn, given Tesla’s subsequent ascent and transformative role in the car industry.Journalist Ross Gerber confirmed this. “I remember when so well. Said it on TV how many times to Cook. Buy tesla buy tesla. Not even a meeting...,” he said in a 2020 tweet.I remember when so well. Said it on TV how many times to Cook. Buy tesla buy tesla. Not even a meeting...— Ross Gerber (@GerberKawasaki) December 22, 2020Later, Cook shared his perspective. According to IndiaTimes, Cook said, \"You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon. And there are lots of companies out there that we could’ve bought from at different times, probably. But I feel really good about where we are today.\"Cook’s statement suggests a possible oversight or deliberate omission of the proposal. He further noted, “I don\\'t recall it happening that way. But if he says it did, I take his word for it.”This episode underscores a potentially groundbreaking merger in the realms of technology and automotive. For Musk, it represented a quest for rescue during Tesla’s trying times. For Cook and Apple, it marked a decision point, opting to continue their established path of strategy and product innovation instead of exploring new automotive avenues.In retrospect, Cook’s decision not to pursue Musk’s offer appears to be a significant turning point. It highlights the unpredictable nature of the tech industry, where today’s uncertainty can lead to tomorrow’s success. Tesla’s journey since then has been a meteoric rise.In the tech industry, potential partnerships are continuously explored, and what might seem like a missed opportunity can lead to independent paths of monumental success.Startups offer ground-level opportunities where newcomers can invest, innovate and potentially become the next big success story. Just as Tesla emerged from its struggles to become a leader in its field, any newcomer in the tech industry could potentially rise to prominence, either independently or through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.The tech landscape is dynamic and full of possibilities, where today’s small venture could be tomorrow’s industry titan or part of an even larger enterprise, mirroring the potential path Tesla and Apple could have taken.Original publication: December 1, 2023\"ACTIVE INVESTORS\\' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article Elon Musk Wanted To Sell Tesla To Apple, But CEO Tim Cook Does Not Recall Ever Speaking To Him originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

       "  \"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 largest economies in the world by 2040. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Economies in the World by 2040.The current scenario of the global economy doesn’t give us a clear picture of the near-term economic situation with certainty. The recent major events that led to global economic uncertainty began with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was followed by worldwide lockdowns, supply chain distributions, international trade cut-offs, downsizing, and most importantly, a crisis in the global health sector. As we mentioned earlier, the economy seems to be in the recovery stage with global growth expected to remain steady at 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025.\\xa0According to research by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), the world’s fastest years of economic growth have likely already passed. Population growth is weakening, climate change, and increasing geopolitical risks, among other factors will impact the global economy. However, the emerging economies and major economies in Asia are directed to keep catching up to richer countries. According to the IMF's GDP forecast for 2030, 16 Asian countries will be among the leading economies. China, India, Indonesia, and Japan will be among the top six economies by 2050 along with the US and Germany. As per The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE:GS) 2075 forecast, China will be the leading economy with India in second place, the US in third place, and Indonesia in fourth. Nigeria and Pakistan will climb up the ranks to fifth and sixth place in 2075, respectively.\\xa0The global economy is forecasted to grow at an average of 2.8% annually between 2024 and 2029 and to gradually decline thereafter, as per The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). This shows a slow economic growth compared to an average growth rate of 3.6% for the 10 years before the global financial crisis and 3.2% in the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic. The reason for slow economic growth is due to the ebbing population growth rate. During the past 50 years, the global population has halved. According to UN projections, the world’s population is expected to increase by almost 2 billion in the next 30 years. This would mean that in 2050 the world’s population will reach 9.7 billion from the current population of 8 billion. The global population could peak at a forecasted 10.4 billion in the mid-2080s. Apart from the population, economists expect weakening productivity to be another key reason for slow GDP growth in the future.\\xa0Despite the slow economic growth worldwide, emerging economies will keep on growing more swiftly than developed economies. China is most likely to overtake the US by 2035, becoming the world’s largest economy. China, India, and Indonesia have outperformed Goldman Sachs economists’ forecasts from 2011, while Brazil, Russia, and Latin America have underperformed Goldman Sachs’ projections. According to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE:GS) economists:“We expect that the weight of global GDP will shift (even) more towards Asia over the next 30 years.”Corporations are always a key element in driving the growth of an economy. The US is way ahead of most economies as far as the dominance of corporations is concerned around the world. Leading firms including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are key to the US economic progress. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are bigger than most economies, having a market capitalization of $2.92 trillion and $3.12 trillion, as of February 10.\\xa0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a big player in the tech sector. On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The company posted earnings per share of $2.18, beating consensus estimates by $0.08 per share. The revenue came in at $119.58 billion, surpassing estimates by $1.31 billion. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made the following comments during its Q1 2024 earnings call:“We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double-digits year-over-year.”Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another leading global tech firm. On January 30, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The company reported earnings per share of $2.93, surpassing estimates by $0.16. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) revenue was $62.02 billion for Q2 2024, ahead of market consensus by $888.19 million. The company continues to expand its cloud and AI network. Here are some of the comments from the Q2 2024 earnings call:“It was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLM and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data, and tools on Azure.”Now, let’s take a look at the largest economies in the world by 2040.\\xa025 Largest Economies in the World by 2040Our MethodologyWe have compiled the largest economies in the world by 2040 based on projections made by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). To check the room for subjectivity, we also referred to forecasts made by the IMF and PwC for the biggest economies in the world in 2028 and 2050, respectively. To rank the largest economies in the world by 2040, we used the forecasted real GDP for 2040 from The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE:GS) Global Economics Paper The Path to 2075. For the countries with similar forecasted real GDP in 2040, we used Population as a tie-breaker. We collected population data from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division.\\xa0By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

       "  'The most famous – and arguably the best – Super Bowl ad in history, the Apple “1984” ad, was nearly killed by the company for whom it was made.The 60-second ad, which announced the arrival of the groundbreaking Macintosh, shows a dystopian gathering of an audience of gray-looking men with gray identical outfits and shaved heads watching a leader on a large screen speak in almost unintelligible words about the goal of conformity and “information purification collectors.”A young woman wearing running shorts and a sleeveless t-shirt runs into the room, chased by helmeted police, and throws a hammer at the screen, exploding it into a white light. At that point a narrator comes on reading the words that also appear on the screen.“On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh,” he said. “And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like ‘1984.’”The spot helped to change not just how people thought about having a computer in their homes, but it also changed the way the nation’s top companies thought about advertising during the Super Bowl.The game is now packed with commercials that advertisers spend millions producing, even before they pay millions more to air the spots, in an effort to make an impression with an audience that generally does its best to avoid commercials. But it’s helped to make the ads as interesting as the game itself for some viewers.But Apple’s board of directors hated the 1984 ad, according to some of the ad executives who worked on the campaign. It didn’t show the computer it was ostensibly about, unlike most ads that try to show the product they’re hyping. And Apple’s board wasn’t very happy. Most ads didn’t seek to remind people of a dark world urging conformity.They hated it so much, in fact, that they ordered the agency that made it, Chiat/Day, to sell off the time they had already purchased on that year’s Super Bowl, rather than run the ad.“Everyone loved it until we showed it to the board,” said Lee Clow, who was one of the executives who created the iconic ad. He said that Steve Jobs, Apple’s founder, largest individual shareholder and the driving creative force behind Apple products, was fully supportive of the ad that never showed the product.“Steve demanded, ‘I want something that will stop the world to introduce Macintosh,’” Clow said. “We came up with bravest thing we could come up with.”So the agency and Jobs worked together to make sure it got on that year’s Super Bowl, days ahead of the product’s introduction, despite the opposition from CEO John Scully and the board.“We kind of conspired to not sell [the already purchased air time] so we could run it one time” Clow said. “We got a pretty big impact just running it once.”Apple did not respond to a request for comment for this story.The reaction, both in the ad industry and among viewers was overwhelmingly positive, Clow said.“In my opinion it’s the best ad ever made,” said Marcus Collins, professor of marketing at the University of Michigan. “It’s about the magnification of the brand’s beliefs. It has become the gold standard of what marketing communications should be about. Advertising is about getting people’s attention.”He said the attention this ad brought to Apple is difficult to overestimate.“It was only shown once but we’re talking about it 40 years later because of its impact and cultural resonance,” he said.He said it also changed the way that companies thought about Super Bowl ads in the 40 years since it aired.“What we’ve seen is companies say, ‘We can’t do our normal ad. We have to step it up in production values and story we tell,’” he said. “They still fall short of what that ad did.”The ad was directed by Ridley Scott, who had already made the movie Alien and Blade Runner, but was still making some commercials in the UK.Clow said Scott was one of those who said “Let’s do something that doesn’t look anything like advertising, that looks like a feature film.”But the Apple board hated everything about the ad, he said.“They didn’t like or understand the commercial. They thought it was a waste of money,” Clow said. “It didn’t show the product. It didn’t show what the product did. It just confused their left brain. They were thinking logically, rather than emotionally and passionately like Steve was thinking.”The ad ran many more times, for free, on news reports for years to come. But a year later, a clash between Jobs and Scully led the board to force Jobs out of the company.Chiat/Day, the agency that created the ad people are still talking about 40 years later, was fired by Apple soon afterward. Scully wanted to work with the more conventional agency he had worked with before at Pepsico.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com'],\n",

       "  'Warren Buffett shared a look into a conversation with Steve Jobs about Apple Inc.\\'s financial strategy during a 2012 appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”In the \"Ask Warren\" segment, Buffett said, “It was an interesting conversation because I hadn’t talked to him in a long time. He said, ‘We’ve got all this cash. What should we do with it?’ So we went over the alternatives. It was kind of interesting.”This dialogue between two titans of industry sheds light on the decision-making process at one of the world’s most valuable companies.Jobs, known for his transformative role in making Apple a global technology leader, reached out to Buffett to seek advice on the company’s cash-management strategies. Buffett, a legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., outlined the four primary options available for deploying cash: stock buybacks, dividends, acquisitions or holding onto it.Don\\'t Miss:For many first-time buyers, a house is about 3 to 5 times your household annual income – Are you making enough?Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.Despite Jobs’s acknowledgment that Apple’s stock was undervalued, indicating that buybacks could be a wise choice, he ultimately decided against taking any action, preferring to maintain the company’s cash reserves.“I went through the logic of each thing. He told me they would not have the chance to make big acquisitions that would require lots of money,\" Buffett said. \"And then I asked him the question, I said, ‘I would use it for buybacks if I thought my stock was undervalued.’ And I said, ‘How do you feel about that?’ The stock was 200-and-something. He said, ‘I think my stock is very undervalued.’ I said, ‘Well, what better to do with your money?’\"Jobs liked having the cash and that was what he ultimately decided was his best option. Buffett added that Jobs interpreted their conversation as Buffett endorsing his decision to hold onto the cash. \"I later learned that he said I agreed with him to do nothing with the cash,\" Buffett said.Trending: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?The conversation between Jobs and Buffett highlights a cautious approach to financial management, contrasting sharply with the actions taken by Jobs’s successor Tim Cook. Under Cook’s leadership, Apple has aggressively pursued stock buybacks, spending over $500 billion on them in the last decade. According to Business Insider, this expenditure surpasses the market capitalization of major corporations like Visa Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and ExxonMobil Corp., underscoring the scale of Apple’s commitment to repurchasing its shares.Apple’s buyback strategy has enhanced shareholder value and increased the stake of Berkshire Hathaway in the tech giant without additional investment. Berkshire Hathaway, owning nearly 6% of Apple, has seen its ownership stake grow as a result of these buybacks.Buffett has publicly supported Apple’s repurchase efforts, noting in his 2021 letter to shareholders the positive impact of the buybacks on both Berkshire’s holdings and Apple’s broader ecosystem.“Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act we applaud,” Buffett wrote. “Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his first love, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.”While Jobs exhibited a preference for liquidity and financial flexibility, Cook has leveraged Apple’s financial strength to actively manage its capital structure, reinforcing the company’s position as a leader in the technology sector and delivering value to its shareholders and stakeholders alike.Read Next: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved?

       "  'Long-term investors have been well served by index funds, which often charge very low fees and can be hard for active portfolio managers to beat. But some investors want to select individual stocks for portions of their portfolios. While it can be very difficult to pick those, a long-term look at quality financial performers might be an excellent way to begin your own research.My estate is worth millions of dollars. How do I stop my daughters’ husbands from getting their hands on it?I inherited $246,000 from my mother and used $142,000 to pay off our mortgage.

Now they insist we give our niece $125,000.Shopify’s stock tanks after earnings. Here’s what’s spooking Wall Street.Your objective needs to be at the heart of your decision. For example, if you are looking to build up a stream of dividend income from stocks, investing in companies that have increased their dividend payouts might be a good approach .If your objective is growth, you might go for a quick killing by trying to pinpoint the next hot trend, or set of trends, that other investors haven’t identified and bid up yet. Good luck with that.A broad indexing approach has worked well. For example, the S&P 500 SPX has returned 554% over the past 20 years through Feb. 9, for an average annual return of 9.8%, according to FactSet. (All returns in this article include reinvested dividends.) In a note to clients on Feb. 12, Ned Davis Research analyst London Stockton wrote that a look at nearly 100 years of market data showed that the S&P 500 had an average annual return of 10.2%, “excluding costs.” He added: “During this time there have been no negative 20- or 30-year periods, with 96.6% of 10-year periods positive.”One easy way to ride along with the U.S. benchmark index has been to hold shares of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, which has annual expenses of 0.0945% of assets under management and has returned 542% over the past 20 years, with an average annual return of 9.7%. There are also newer S&P 500 index funds with fees lower than those of SPY.For individual stocks, a company’s return on invested capital can shed light on how strong operating performance over the long term can be correlated to good stock performance.A company’s return on invested capital is its net income divided by the sum of the carrying value of its common stock, preferred stock, long-term debt and capitalized lease obligations.ROIC is an annualized figure that highlights how efficiently a management team allocates capital — in other words, how well it makes use of the money investors have provided to run the business. It isn’t necessarily a fair way of looking at performance, because different industries are naturally more capital-intensive than others. But we don’t need to be fair when taking a broad look at the stock market.The carrying value of a company’s stock may be much lower than its current market capitalization. The company may have issued most of its shares many years ago at a price much lower than today’s price. If a company has issued a large amount of newer shares recently, or at relatively high prices, its ROIC will be lower. If a company has low debt, its ROIC is higher. If a company is being forced to increase borrowings, especially as interest rates are rising, its ROIC will go down.We recently included five- and 10-year lookbacks at ROIC as part of an analysis of the largest 10 components of the S&P 500 by market capitalization, in order to isolate which ones might represent the best value for investors .But today we are taking a more extreme approach, looking back 20 years.FactSet calculates companies’ ROIC each quarter for rolling four-quarter periods. Since many companies have fiscal years that don’t match the calendar, the most recent ROIC calculations encompass each company’s past four quarterly financial reports.For a 20-year screen of the S&P 500, we began with the current ROIC figures, then went to those of four fiscal quarters ago, then eight quarters and so on, to have 20 12-month ROIC snapshots for our 20-year averages.Among the S&P 500, 20 years of ROIC data is available from FactSet for 342 companies, and 20-year total returns are available for all but six. FactSet might have 20 years of ROIC data even for a company that hasn’t been publicly traded for 20 years: For example, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL went public as Google Inc. in August 2004.For the remaining 336 companies in the S&P 500, these 20 have had the highest average returns on invested capital over the past 20 years:Company Ticker 20-year average ROIC 10-year average ROIC Return, 20 Years Avg. 20-year return Return, 10 Years VeriSign Inc.VRSN241.9%460.9%1,166%13.5%277%Accenture PLC Class AACN54.0%39.9%2,167%16.9%451%AutoZone Inc.AZO36.7%40.3%2,884%18.5%401%HP Inc.HPQ36.6%63.7%306%7.3%190%Idexx Laboratories Inc.IDXX36.3%47.6%4,379%20.9%863%Paychex Inc.PAYX36.3%38.3%531%9.7%306%Yum Brands Inc.YUM33.0%40.3%1,464%14.7%204%Apple Inc.AAPL33.0%37.5%55,015%37.1%1,055%Colgate-Palmolive Co.CL32.6%29.9%382%8.2%73%S&P Global Inc.SPGI32.5%32.9%1514%14.9%510%Monster Beverage Corp.MNST32.5%24.1%51,682%36.7%388%TJX Cos.

Among these 20 companies, 15 have beaten the S&P 500’s 20-year return. Apple Inc. AAPL has had the best 20-year and 10-year returns. For 10 years, Apple’s return has been double that of the second-best performer on the list, NVR Inc. NVR. And Apple’s 10-year average ROIC has been higher than its 20-year average ROIC.Mastercard Inc. MA, with a 20-year average ROIC of 37.6%, would have made the top 20 list, but the company only went public in May 2006. The company’s average 10-year ROIC has been 46.2%. The stock has returned 538% over the past 10 years.VeriSign Inc. VRSN had has the highest ROIC by far among the S&P 500.

During an interview in September, Brad Klapmeyer, a managing director and senior portfolio manager at Ivy Investments, said VeriSign’s arrangement with the Commerce Department had changed in recent years to allow greater flexibility with pricing, and that the simplicity of the company’s business meant it needed little invested capital to fund its operations.Don’t miss:  This fund manager stopped worrying about economics.

       "  \"In this article, we discuss 13 best metaverse stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the metaverse, head directly to 5 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now.\\xa0The global metaverse market was valued at $98.7 billion in 2023, and it is anticipated to grow significantly, reaching $1,402.5 billion by 2032. IMARC Group predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.29% during the forecast period of 2024-2032. Factors supporting this growth include advancements in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, and cloud computing. Additionally, increased user interest in immersive digital experiences, online gaming, social media platforms, enhanced internet connectivity, and a growing desire for personalized experiences contribute to the metaverse’s expansion. Tarik Chebib, Capital.com’s chief revenue officer, told Reuters:\\xa0“The internet will end as we know it and the metaverse will totally reshape the global economy.”The gaming industry, with its widespread use of alternative realities in games like Fortnite and Roblox, is poised to play a pivotal role in the metaverse, according to Tarik Chebib. Given the global user base of 3.2 billion gamers, there is substantial potential demand for the metaverse revolution. Furthermore, the gaming sector contributes valuable software expertise to serve as the foundation for metaverse development. The primary deficiency lies in hardware, as per Chebib, who emphasized the necessity for a streamlined solution that doesn't require users to wear bulky headsets for participation. The gaming sector is expected to be a significant beneficiary of the metaverse's growth, projected to represent around half of the market by 2024, totaling $400 billion. Major players in this domain include Epic Games, Roblox, and Microsoft, which strengthened its position with the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, creators of Call of Duty, for a historic $69 billion. Microsoft's leadership in the industry, particularly with titles like Minecraft, suggests a trend where other companies may follow suit. Chebib further commented:\\xa0“Video games help us visualize what the metaverse could look like. Gaming companies are really interesting cases as they have already created worlds where people buy skins, avatars and collect different things.”2022 was expected to be the year of the metaverse, marked by Facebook's transformation to Meta in October 2021, reflecting Mark Zuckerberg’s enthusiasm for the potential of virtual and augmented reality. However, this did not materialize, and in 2023, the metaverse took a backseat to artificial intelligence. However, in 2024, there is potential for a metaverse resurgence in public attention as Apple launched its $3,500 Vision Pro headset, announced midway through 2023. Speculation suggests it could have a transformative impact on the metaverse similar to what the iPhone did for smartphones and the iPad did for portable tablet computing.Some of the best metaverse stocks to invest in include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\\xa0Our Methodology\\xa0We assessed the total holdings of the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSE:METV) and chose the top metaverse stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\\xa0Photo by David Dvořáček on UnsplashNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a technology company facilitating digital payments globally for both merchants and consumers. On February 7, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.48 and a revenue of $8 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.12 and $130 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the number of payment transactions rose by 13%, reaching 6.8 billion, while the total payment transactions for the fiscal year 2023 increased by 12% to 25 billion. Despite that, active accounts decreased 2% year-over-year, amounting to 426 million.\\xa0According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 78 hedge funds were bullish on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), compared to 86 funds in the prior quarter. Gavin Baker’s Atreides Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.17 million shares worth $244 million.\\xa0Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the best metaverse stocks to monitor.\\xa0Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also contributed less to portfolio performance than most holdings during the fourth quarter. The total payment volume handled by PayPal during its most recent quarter grew +15%, which helped drive healthy revenue growth and +20% earnings per share growth. Critically, the Company’s new management team has significant opportunity to drive more revenue and earnings growth across the massive, multi-trillion-dollar payments addressable market. PayPal’s rapidly growing payment processing brand, Braintree, represents one of those revenue growth opportunities, either by raising prices, as the Company had previously used a low-price strategy to establish a beachhead in this market, or by adding value-added services. PayPal’s branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants. We added to our position with the stock trading at just 10X forward earnings estimates during the quarter because there are many more long-term growth opportunities relative to most financial companies that trade for similar multiples and compared to technology companies that trade for much higher multiples.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global semiconductor company specializing in the design and supply of semiconductor devices. It operates in two segments – Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software. It is one of the best metaverse stocks to invest in. On December 7, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $11.06 and a revenue of $9.3 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.10 and $20 million, respectively.\\xa0According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 87 hedge funds were long Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), compared to 72 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.70 billion.\\xa0ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.Semiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a global entertainment company with three segments – Entertainment, Sports, and Experiences. On February 8, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) declared a $0.45 per share semi-annual dividend, a 50% increase from the prior dividend of $0.30. The dividend is payable on July 25, to shareholders of record as of July 8.\\xa0According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 89 hedge funds were bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to 92 funds in the preceding quarter. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 32.8 million shares worth $2.66 billion.\\xa0Madison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).\\xa0 The Walt Disney Company is facing a difficult and uncertain transition in its core media business assets including the ESPN business and other linear media assets. These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 107Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, and sale of integrated circuits and semiconductor devices globally. It is one of the top metaverse stocks to watch. On February 7, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) reported a revenue of approximately NT$215.79 billion for January, showing a 7.9% increase from January 2023 and a 22.4% rise from December. TSMC also recently announced plans to construct a second chip fabrication facility in Japan in collaboration with Sony, Denso, Toyota, and the Japanese government.\\xa0According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 107 hedge funds were bullish on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), compared to 121 funds in the last quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is a significant position holder in the company, with a stake worth $780.3 million.\\xa0Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) was also a top contributor to performance. The Company began shipping chips that were fabricated using its industry-leading “N3″ node. Nearly all of the Company’s N3 capacity has been filled by high-end chip designers such as Apple, NVIDIA and even Intel. As high-performance computing, particularly related to AI in both data centers and edge devices, continues to build momentum, the Company will be a key supplier for many years to come. Despite the boom-and-bust cycle in demand seen for many semiconductors during Covid-19 and post-Covid-19, the Company should be able to post solid double-digit growth next year as inventories and end-market demand across most of its technology nodes get back to normal levels. The Company also maintains dominant market share in leading-edge nodes, which is in short supply, given the difficulties its competitors have had in scaling up EUV-based manufacturing. The Company has been able to secure higher prices because of this and can still generate excellent returns on elevated capital expenditures necessary for this scarce capacity. The Company is arguably one of a handful of the world’s most important and largest companies, but because the Company’s shares trade as an ADR (American Depositary Receipt) the shares are not part of the major stock market indices in the U.S. As a result, the shares are woefully under owned by U.S. investors (institutional and individual), particularly for a company that regularly generates cash flow return on invested capital in excess of +40%. Therefore, our growing position in these shares represent a significantly relatively overweight portfolio position versus our peers and benchmarks. We could not be more pleased by this anachronistic institutional imperative.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) offers technology infrastructure and marketing services to enable engagement between merchants, brands, and businesses with users and customers worldwide. It is one of the best metaverse stocks to buy. On February 7, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPADS of $2.67 and a revenue of $36.67 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.03 and $270 million, respectively. Alibaba announced that its board has authorized a $25 billion expansion of its stock buyback program until the end of March 2027. The company now has $35.3 billion remaining for share repurchases over the next three fiscal years.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), compared to 112 funds in the preceding quarter.\\xa0L1 Long Short Fund made the following comment about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (Long -18%) shares weakened in recent months as Chinese reopening strength faded and macro-economic data points began sequentially declining. Nevertheless, we believe the Chinese government will use consumption as a key lever to reinvigorate the economy post-COVID lockdowns. Alibaba remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud, and management is taking proactive steps to unlock shareholder value. It has announced plans to split into six major business groups – Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media, and Entertainment Group. Each group will be managed independently, with a separate CEO and board, have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this restructure will be a strong positive catalyst to unlock the sum-of-the-parts valuation upside in the company.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units, and other related products and services. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best metaverse stocks to monitor.\\xa0On February 1, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, projecting $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi analyst Christopher Danely suggested that AMD might be intentionally underestimating the revenue and there are indications that the actual figures could exceed the projections. Danely estimates that AMD might generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from the MI300, a product associated with artificial intelligence.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion.\\xa0White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) ranks 7th on our list of the best metaverse stocks to invest in. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a global software company operating in three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. On December 18, Adobe and Figma jointly announced the cancellation of their $20 billion merger due to increasing regulatory challenges globally. The companies stated that they see no clear path to obtaining necessary approvals from the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority. In light of the terminated deal, Adobe will pay Figma the agreed-upon $1 billion termination fee. Following this development, Barclays upgraded Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock to Overweight, citing reduced concerns over dilution.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter.\\xa0Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 134Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has shown an increased commitment to the metaverse with the recent announcement of its first mixed-reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro. The headset provides users with virtual and augmented reality experiences, offering a gateway to a version of the metaverse. It features Apple's metaverse-style operating system, VisionOS, emphasizing spatial computing. The launch signals Apple's strategic move into the extended reality (XR) landscape. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the best metaverse stocks to watch.\\xa0According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 134 hedge funds were long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 135 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 915.5 million shares valued at $156.75 billion.\\xa0In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on our list of the best metaverse stocks to invest in.\\xa0Bireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”\\xa0Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now.\\xa0 Suggested articles:13 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds11 Best Small Cap Electric Vehicle Stocks to Invest In26 Largest Mining Companies by Market Cap\\xa0Disclosure: None.\\xa013 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now\\xa0is originally published on Insider Monkey.\"],\n",

       "  \"After disappointing investors in 2022, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) delivered stellar returns in 2023 alongside the recovery of tech stocks. The company started 2024 on the right foot as well, handsomely beating Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter. Meta seems to be following in the footsteps of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is evident from its newfound interest in rewarding shareholders handsomely, not just with buybacks, but also with dividends. In a surprise move, the company announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, initiating a dividend program against all odds. The company also boosted its stock repurchase authorization by $50 billion to complement the dividend. Stellar fourth-quarter earnings coupled with the company's announcement of its first-ever dividend sent the stock 20% higher following the earnings report last week.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.A closer evaluation of Meta's prospects reveals it is well-positioned to grow from here and is still reasonably valued despite a meaningful expansion in valuation multiples in the last 12 months.From a high of 41% in 2019, Meta's operating margin reached a trough of 28.80% in 2022 with the company's aggressive investments in the metaverse failing to deliver the desired returns. Deteriorating operating margins forced the social media giant to take bold steps to improve its profitability in 2023, starting with the launch of a new campaign named Year of Efficiency. The company's operating margin ballooned to 36.30% in 2023 with it benefiting from several positive changes it implemented over the last 12 months. This is a positive sign as Meta is now moving forward as a more agile, leaner company that is capable of aggressively investing in artificial intelligence.Meta was among the many tech companies to focus on a lean business structure in 2023. The company ended the year with 67,317 employees compared to a total headcount of 86,482 in 2022. Despite a notable reduction in headcount, it performed exceptionally well across all of its business segments, including 16% year-over-year growth in revenue, 8% growth in family daily active people and a 28% increase in ad impressions. Meta's aggressive layoffs in the last 15 months have helped its operating performance, which is evident from the meaningful margin improvement reported for 2023.Meta's mass layoffs should not cloud the judgment of investors when it comes to evaluating its long-term prospects. Despite a focus on efficiency gains, the company has not lost its focus on strategic investments to ensure long-term growth.During the fourth-quarter earnings call, the company highlighted its commitment to deploying approximately 350,000 H100 chips to develop world-class computing infrastructure to penetrate the opportunities in the AI space. The massive computing power of the company will be used to improve Reels and develop AI capabilities to support the growth of Reels across Facebook and Instagram.The company is also investing in custom silicon for specialized workloads to further accelerate the company's expansion as an AI-first social media giant. Last May, the company unveiled MTIA, Meta's first-generation AI inference accelerator, to handle content understanding, feeds and ads ranking more effectively.Meta's investments in AI will enable it to develop and deploy advanced AI services on its platforms in the future, potentially dealing a massive blow to its rivals who are still at the infant stages when it comes to deploying AI to improve ad performance and user retention.The company is taking a long-term approach to AI development, spending millions of dollars every quarter on developing Llama models 5,6 and 7 to emerge as a leader in the generative AI space. These AI investments will directly impact revenue in several ways going forward.First, Meta is using AI to enhance its advertising platform. %he company has already launched Advantage+, a portfolio of solutions aimed at improving the return on investment of advertisers. This product suite allows advertisers to automate parts of the campaign creation process, including audience targeting, likely leading to efficiency gains. The company has also introduced text variation and image expansion features using generative AI to help marketers create high-quality advertisements to reach a global audience.Second, Meta is leveraging AI to improve business messaging capabilities on WhatsApp Business. The company is testing AI-driven business support in chat to help business owners seamlessly conduct business through WhatsApp. According to management, click-to-message ads are continuing to grow and the potential integration of AI into business messaging should boost the revenue from this ad segment in the future.Third, Meta continues to heavily invest in Reality Labs, including investments in augmented rality and virtual reality product development, which should create new revenue streams in the long run. The company's VR headset, Oculus, is already bringing in revenue, but is still at an infant stage when it comes to unlocking the true potential of the mixed-reality headset space. With additional investments in AI supporting the introduction of groundbreaking features, Meta may emerge as a global leader in the AR/VR product space in the long run.Overall, Meta's strategic investments in AI should help its growth in the coming years.Just over five years ago, Apple decided to pursue a net cash neutral goal when it started generating more than enough cash from operations to support investments and debt repayments. To achieve this objective, the company aggressively repurchased stock and paid dividends, rewarding long-term shareholders. For context, Apple spent an average of $37 billion per year on share repurchases between 2013 and 2018, but since then, it has spent $82 billion on stock buybacks per annum. Unlike Apple, Meta Platforms still enjoys a long runway for growth and the company is investing to expand. However, Meta also generates substantial operating cash flows ($71 billion in 2023) and the company only carries $18 billion in long-term debt. This strong financial position allows it to distribute wealth to shareholders, which is exactly what the company is doing today.Apple's net income has grown at a compound annual rate of 10.25% between 2018 and 2023, but earnings per share grew at an annualized rate of 15.51% over the same period, aided by substantial buybacks that reduced the share count. Meta, on the other hand, is well-positioned to see strong net income growth, so aggressive buybacks will multiply earnings per share growth in the next few years. Strong earnings growth should support premium valuations.Meta, at a forward price-earnings ratio of 23.92, is expensively valued compared to its five-year average of 22.23. This premium valuation, however, seems justifiable given the company is in better shape than ever to grow profitably, aided by its continued dominance in the social media space and the narrowing losses of the Reality Labs division. Meta's buybacks will also play a major role in boosting earnings growth, thereby allowing the company to trade at higher stock prices without a further expansion in earnings multiples.Investors will have to monitor a few key risks, including the company's exposure to China (approximately 10% of revenue in fourth-quarter 2023) and the regulatory challenges in North America and Europe.Meta Platforms stock, even on the back of a 146% gain in the last 12 months, looks reasonably priced at a time when it is enjoying a noteworthy expansion in profit margins, which allows it to invest in its future while rewarding shareholders with dividends and buybacks. Some volatility is expected in the coming months if macroeconomic conditions in China threaten Meta's short-term profits, but in the long term, the company should thrive even if its China business faces a permanent decline.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\"],\n",

       "  'Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported first-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 1. According to the press release, the company posted revenue of $119.6 billion, up 2% year over year, and earnings of $2.18 per share, up 16%. The company highlighted that its services revenue reached a new all-time record and earnings reached a new all-time high as well. The installed base of Apple\\'s active devices surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all product and geographic segments. Overall, first-quarter earnings were in line with expectations. However, the stock was down a little bit the next day.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.The company\\'s services revenue grew 11.3% year over year. This is encouraging because it shows the growing power of Apple\\'s iOS ecosystem. On the hardware side, both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories saw sales decline during the quarter. IPad sales declined 25.3%. CEO Tim Cook\\'s explanation for this year-over-year decline during the earnings call was a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue declined 11.3%. Again, the decline was also due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Macbook sales were up 1% year over year. Cook remarked that this increase was driven by the strength of Apple\\'s latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales.Apple\\'s most important business is obviously the iPhone, which accounted for 58.3% of revenue for the quarter. IPhone revenue grew 6% year over year, which was slower than the overall growth of the global smartphone market but faster than its biggest competitor Samsung (XKRX:005930).According to preliminary data from the International Data Corp. Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, global smartphone shipments declined 3.2% year over year to 1.17 billion units in 2023. The fourth quarter (4Q23) saw 8.5% year-over-year growth and 326.1 million shipments, higher than the forecast of 7.3% growth.The iPhone\\'s market share reached an all-time high and Apple surpassed Samsung to become the top player for the first time.The iPhone obviously had a great quarter, but there is one big ominous sign Apple\\'s revenue in China declined by double digits during the quarter.During the earnings call, the weaker performance in China was asked about a few times by various Wall Street analysts. Cook sounded optimistic about China in the long term, but it is almost guaranteed the iPhone will lose market share in China going forward because Huawei is back.Huawei\\'s smartphone business was basically decimated after the U.S. sanctioned Huawai in 2019. According to Counterpoint Research Global Smartphone Tracker and Forecast, the company\\'s market share declined from more than 30% to less than 6% in 2022.When the U.S. sanctioned Huawei, it looked like it was game over as the company could not get the high-end chips it needed to produce its smartphones. However, after more than four years of sanctions, Huawei miraculously came back and announced its high-end 5G Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro smartphones at the end of August. The two devices immediately became best-sellers in China after launch. This had an immediate impact on the iPhone\\'s market share in China.According to Counterpoint\\'s latest report on the Chinese market, Huawei\\'s \"shipments soared 41% year over year in the third quarter of 2023 as its newly launched Mate 60 series with Kirin SoC gained momentum immediately after the launch. Apple also experienced a slight year over year uptick in shipments driven by the newly launched iPhone 15 series, but the initial supply constraints impacted its overall performance. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Apple\\'s iPhone shipments in China dropped 2%, while Huawei\\'s shipments increased by 36.20%.Clearly, Huawei is taking market share from Apple in China since the launch of Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro. The challenge for Apple with Huawei\\'s comeback is at least twofold. First of all, Huawei is very likely to continue to take market share from Apple in China in the foreseeable future. Second, Huawei might be able to take market share from Apple outside of China if its momentum can expand overseas. With Huawei\\'s track record, I would not bet on Apple to maintain its worldwide market share going forward. If Apple cannot maintain its worldwide market share, then obviously Apple\\'s fundamentals are likely to be impacted.Apple\\'s overall first-quarter earnings were very satisfactory. However, its business declined in China, which is its third-largest geographic market, mostly due to Huawei\\'s launch of new high-end products. If Huawei is successful in its future product launches, Apple\\'s China and global businesses may be adversely impacted. Investors should keep an eye on Huawei.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.'],\n",

       "  'Chicago, IL – February 12, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META and Nvidia NVDA.The overall picture that has emerged from the Q4 earnings season is one of stability and resilience as a whole, with key pockets starting to enjoy notable acceleration regarding growth momentum.Earnings aren’t great, but then again, no one expected corporate profitability to be great. The earnings naysayers have been relatively less vocal in their doom-and-gloom pronouncements lately. But the fear of an impending earnings cliff has been in the back of market participants’ minds. These results have likely eased many of those fears.With quarterly results from about two-thirds of S&P 500 members already out through Friday, February 9th, here are the five key features these quarterly results have confirmed.First, the Q4 earnings and revenue growth pace represents an acceleration from what we have been seeing in recent quarters.The absolute level of Q4 earnings and revenue growth isn’t much, and the improving trend may not seem like a big deal to some of you. But we nevertheless see this improving growth trend as significant and a sign of the things to come in the coming periods.For the 338 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday, February 9th, total earnings and revenues are up +5.5% and +3.7% from the same period last year, respectively. Concerning the beats percentages, 80.5% of the companies have beaten EPS estimates, and 65% have beaten revenue estimates.Second, companies are making good progress on the margins front.The year-over-year change in net margins turned positive in 2023 Q3 after staying in negative territory for six consecutive quarters. This margins recovery is a key driver of earnings growth in the coming periods.At the sector level, Q4 net margins are above the year level for 9 of the 16 sectors, with the biggest gains at Tech, Consumer Discretionary, Retail, Industrial Products, Utilities, Finance and others.On the negative side, Q4 margins are below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines at the Medical, Autos, Energy and Transportation sectors.Third, the Tech sector is firmly back in the growth mode now, and the trend is expected to continue going forward.For the 64.5% of Tech companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already, total earnings are up +21.5% on +6.4% higher revenues, with 86% beating EPS estimates and 72% beating revenue estimates.Looking at Q4 results for the sector as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total Tech sector earnings are on track to be up +25.4% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues.The sector went through a period of post-Covid adjustment in 2022 and the first half of 2023 when it became a drag on the aggregate growth picture.Please remember that Tech isn’t just any other sector, as it’s the biggest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index. The sector is currently expected to bring in 28.5% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period, with the second and third biggest contributors in Finance and Medical at 17.7% and 12.5%, respectively.What this means is that the Tech sector’s growth profile has a significant impact on the aggregate picture, both negative as well as positive. The Tech sector dragged down the aggregate growth picture in 2022 and the first half of 2023, now appearing ready to resume its historical positive growth role.Please note that the Tech sector is instrumental in keeping the aggregate growth picture in positive territory in Q4. Of the reported results, the +5.5% earnings growth drops to a decline of -0.7% when Technology is excluded from the results.Fourth, related to the Tech sector’s strong showing is the dominance of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies – Apple, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla.Each of the Mag 7 companies relies on technological innovation to dominate its respective space. But strictly speaking, not all of them are in the Tech sector, as we at Zacks have Amazon as part of the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla as part of the Zacks Auto sector.Nvidia will report its Q4 results on February 21st, but the rest of the Mag 7 members have already reported results. For Q4 as a whole for the group, combining the actuals that have come out for the six group members with estimates for Nvidia, total Mag 7 earnings are expected to be up +48.7% on +14.5% higher revenues.The Mag 7 companies are expected to bring in 20% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2024 and currently account for 29.5% of the index’s total market capitalization.Please note that S&P 500 earnings growth for Q4 would be in negative territory had it not been for the heavy lifting from Mag 7: -3% vs. +5.4%.Five, the revisions trend has notably stabilized after appearing to turn substantially negative at the start of 2023 Q4.Estimates for 2024 Q1 and full-year 2024 are modestly coming down, with negative revisions from some sectors mostly getting offset by positive revisions from others.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Earnings: Tech Sector Back in Growth ModeSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P\\'s +7.0 average gain per year.

       "  '2024-02-12 04:25:00',\n",
       "  'Many tech stocks soared over the past year as the bullish enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware, software, and chips broadly offset the bearish concerns about high interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds.But with the Nasdaq Composite now hovering near an all-time high, some investors might be reluctant to add more tech stocks to their portfolios. However, I believe it\\'s still safe to buy more shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) as the bears fret over a potential downturn. Here\\'s why I would buy these three supercharged tech stocks without hesitation.Meta Platforms, the world\\'s largest social media company, lost its luster in 2022 as Apple\\'s privacy changes for iOS, fierce competition from ByteDance\\'s TikTok, and macro headwinds curbed the growth of its core advertising business. At the same time, it ramped up its spending on its unprofitable Reality Labs business. During that challenging year, its revenue and earnings per share declined 1% and 38%, respectively.But in 2023, Meta\\'s revenue rose 16% as its earnings jumped 73%. Its advertising business recovered as Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies ramped up their spending on Facebook and Instagram, it revamped its algorithms to counter Apple\\'s iOS changes, and it expanded Reels to keep pace with TikTok\\'s short videos. That recovery indicated Meta could continue subsidizing Reality Labs\\' costly expansion with its higher-margin advertising revenue.To top it all off, Meta ended the year with enough cash to initiate its first-ever dividend and boost its existing buyback plan by $50 billion. Analysts expect Meta\\'s revenue and earnings to grow 19% and 31%, respectively, in 2024. Those are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 24 times forward earnings -- so investors shouldn\\'t hesitate to buy Meta right now, even as it trades slightly below its all-time highs.ASML is the world\\'s largest producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It\\'s also the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems for manufacturing the world\\'s smallest and densest chips.ASML\\'s dominance of that crucial chipmaking technology makes it a linchpin of the global semiconductor market. Its revenue rose 30% in 2023 as the world\\'s top foundries installed more EUV systems, but it expects its revenue to stay nearly flat in 2024 as tighter export restrictions throttle its sales to Chinese chipmakers. Analysts expect its revenue to stay flat and for its earnings to decline by 4%.But looking ahead, ASML expects to generate \"significant growth\" in 2025 as PC sales stabilize, the smartphone market warms up, and it ramps up shipments of its next-gen \"high-NA\" EUV systems for the production of even smaller chips. For 2025, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 24% and 45%, respectively.ASML\\'s stock might seem a bit pricey at 43 times forward earnings, but its dominance of the lithography market justifies that higher valuation. Investors who are bullish on the semiconductor market should still buy this stock hand over fist.Broadcom sells a wide range of wireless, optical, data storage, networking, mobile, and industrial chips. It also expanded into the infrastructure software market over the past six years by acquiring CA Technologies, Symantec\\'s enterprise security division, and the cloud software giant VMware.Broadcom still generated a fifth of its revenue from Apple over the last two fiscal years. However, its acquisition of VMware last November -- which boosts its software business to about half of its top line -- should significantly reduce its dependence on the iPhone maker. It should also reduce its overall exposure to the cyclical semiconductor sector and make it a more diversified tech giant.Analysts expect Broadcom\\'s revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 40% and 10%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 (which ends in October) as it integrates VMware. In fiscal 2025, they expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to rise 11% and 20%, respectively, as it laps that acquisition and its integration expenses. Those are robust growth rates for a stock that trades at 27 times forward earnings and pays a forward yield of 1.7%. Investors looking for a stable tech play that offers balanced exposure to the semiconductor, infrastructure software, and cloud markets shouldn\\'t hesitate to buy Broadcom stock today.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

       "  \"If you want to earn strong returns in the stock market, it can be advantageous to see what the best investors are buying. Warren Buffett certainly falls within that esteemed group. The Oracle of Omaha has generated fortune-building gains for Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders for nearly 60 years by investing in high-quality businesses with attractive long-term growth prospects.Here are two of Buffett's favorite stocks in Berkshire's $373 billion investment portfolio.Buffett has been buying shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) aggressively over the past year. It's easy to see why. The oil and gas producer owns some of the most valuable acreage in the shale-rich Permian Basin. It's also a leader in the potentially multitrillion-dollar market for decarbonization solutions.Berkshire first invested in Occidental in 2019 as a part of a deal to help finance the latter's acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum. Buffett's investment conglomerate has purchased shares on multiple occasions since then. Berkshire now owns roughly 28% of Occidental's shares, currently valued at more than $14 billion, along with preferred shares and warrants that could allow it to boost its stake in the oil driller.Buffett is no doubt attracted to Occidental's prized assets in the Permian Basin. The company's operations in the oil- and gas-rich region, which spans from West Texas to southeast New Mexico, are well situated to supply the U.S. and international markets with dependable and cost-effective energy.CEO Vicki Hollub has also positioned Occidental to be a leader in the promising area of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). The forward-thinking executive wants to help build a global network of direct air capture (DAC) facilities. DAC technology, which can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, is expected to play a key role in enabling governments and businesses to achieve their net-zero emissions goals.All told, carbon capture services could become a $4 trillion market by 2050, according to ExxonMobil. Occidental, in turn, believes that its carbon management operations could eventually eclipse its traditional oil and gas businesses.Like Occidental, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is well-positioned to benefit from the long-term growth of massive global markets. With artificial intelligence (AI) set to boost the functionality of its popular devices, the tech titan's profits are poised to climb from their already stratospheric levels.Buffett is clearly a fan. Berkshire Hathaway owns roughly $170 billion worth of Apple stock -- more than five times as much as its second-largest position.Buffett appreciates Apple's fortress-like balance sheet and staggering profitability. With cash and investments of more than $170 billion as of Dec. 30, 2023, and net income of over $100 billion during the trailing 12 months, the iPhone maker displays an unparalleled level of financial fortitude.Buffett also understands the value of Apple's brand. People trust that -- unlike many other high-tech products -- Apple's devices simply work and are intuitive to use. And once someone buys one of the tech specialist's phones or computers, they tend to remain a loyal customer. These factors give the company a level of pricing power that its rivals do not possess, which helps Apple earn higher profit margins.Moreover, with over 2.2 billion devices in use worldwide, Apple has a huge base of customers who are eager to buy its latest products and services. That allows the company to enter new markets and quickly win sales despite charging premium prices. Investors are likely to see this trend play out once again with the tech giant's recent entrance into the augmented reality headset market following the launch of its innovative Apple Vision Pro device.Apple could also be on the verge of an enormous iPhone upgrade cycle. In September, analysts at Morgan Stanley noted that after more consumers chose to wait longer to buy a new phone in 2023, the average iPhone replacement period stood at an all-time high of 4.4 years. With many of these phones nearing the end of their useful lives, there could be enormous pent-up demand for the iPhone 16 due out later this year.Additionally, in January, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan posited that forthcoming AI-powered features will boost iPhone sales in the coming years. Mohan expects the rising popularity of generative AI applications to drive demand for AI-enabled devices in 2024 and 2025, which should also help to support higher services revenue for Apple.With these powerful growth drivers set to propel the tech leader's profit growth, Apple's stock is a solid buy today.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

       "  'This is The Takeaway from today\\'s Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we\\'re watchingWhat we\\'re readingEconomic data releases and earningsConventional thinking suggests that artificial intelligence is driving major disruption at large publicly traded companies.And you wouldn\\'t be wrong in buying into that prevailing thought.Why else does Nvidia\\'s (NVDA) stock price refuse to go lower for any long stretch? The company\\'s leading-edge generative AI chips are extremely in demand by deep-pocketed companies doing the global disruption.Why are layoffs sweeping through Big Tech companies such as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN)? Executives are resetting their cost structures to reinvest in AI, which they believe is needed to annihilate their less-nimble foes.But there is way more disruption going on in corporate America than AI running amok and changing the standard ways of executing.If you stick with the disruptors, you stand to build wealth over time. Conversely, if you fail to spot the disrupted, it\\'s probably going to end badly for your portfolio, full stop.I would like you all to build wealth, not see it go up in smoke, so here are a few examples to use as a template when assessing your own portfolio for disruptors and those being disrupted:Mighty Disney (DIS) just reinforced the blurring lines in media consumption and why it\\'s probably going to be a winner over time.Last Wednesday, in a stroke of genius, the company joined forces with Epic Games for a new digital ecosystem. Digital ecosystems are only likely to grow in importance in the years to come, and Disney realizes this. Why do you think Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) are all in on virtual and augmented reality?With this announcement, Disney likely has the folks at Electronic Arts (EA) shaking in their Madden cleats. Comcast (CMCSA) execs are probably wondering why they didn\\'t pull the trigger on buying EA last year, as was speculated.Couple that with Disney\\'s new streaming sports tie-up with Fox (FOXA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and the company has laid the foundation for a decade of disrupting rivals in media.For instance, what does this new streaming deal mean for Paramount (PARA), which has a lucrative NFL deal through 2032? You can learn more about this disruption in my Yahoo Finance Live interview with Paramount CEO Bob Bakish.Bottom line: AI is not a huge factor in this big media disruption; it\\'s just good old-fashioned structural industry changes.PayPal’s (PYPL) earnings this week reaffirmed the view among many on the Street that it’s a legacy tech company being seriously disrupted, and new CEO Alex Chriss has a tall order in front of him to get investors excited again.As Evercore ISI analyst David Togut wrote: \"PayPal continues to confront the twin challenges of market share and customers loss in its branded PayPal wallet business and negative mix shift toward its high-growth, low-take-rate payments platform, Braintree.\"Who is PayPal being disrupted by? It may be Stripe, Visa (V), American Express (AXP), Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Yet, why are people blah on using PayPal and maybe even Venmo, and what does this all mean for PayPal investors who have endured a 28% stock price decline in the past year?Beats me, but it\\'s all disruption that may get worse before it gets better for the storied payments giant.Bottom line: PayPal\\'s biggest issue also isn\\'t an AI one.What an absolutely awful quarter and conference call for Snap (SNAP) and CEO Evan Spiegel this week.The stock deserved to be hammered by 34% on Wednesday, as it\\'s another earnings period in which Snap\\'s executive team seems to be out to lunch on the mood among its investors.But this disaster says a lot about the flywheel of power for Meta, TikTok, and even Elon Musk’s X, formerly known as Twitter. These three platforms are growing stronger every single day, while Snap appears to be heading down a path of irrelevancy amid intense disruption.For instance, Meta is so back in its groove that it\\'s handing out a dividend for the first time, whereas Snap is handing out pink slips again to 10% of its workforce.One year from now, Snap\\'s story is probably not going to be pretty as its rivals get more entrenched in their winning ways. Blame disruption.Bottom line: There\\'s a little bit of AI disruption in this case, but it\\'s not the overwhelming factor.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance\\'s Executive Editor.

       "  'Car pile-ups are often the result of drivers following one another too closely in low-visibility conditions. Apple seems to be tempting one by being too tolerant of customers using its devices while in the drivers’ seat, and lacking the foresight to anticipate where this could lead.Footage of people using Apple’s new Vision Pro from behind the wheel within days of the headset going on sale\\xa0drew the attention\\xa0of US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg this week, along with the agency within his department that regulates traffic safety.To be clear, as Buttigieg himself reiterated, all vehicles for sale in the United States require human drivers to be fully engaged at all times and ready to take control of the wheel. There is no such things as a \"self-driving car\" at this point, including those equipped with Tesla\\'s Autopilot.\\xa0The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration followed up with a statement deeming driving with headsets “reckless” and in disregard of everyone on the road.Reminder—ALL advanced driver assistance systems available today require the human driver to be in control and fully engaged in the driving task at all times. pic.twitter.com/OpPy36mOgC — Secretary Pete Buttigieg (@SecretaryPete) February 5, 2024Apple, for its part, declined to comment on the videos and referred to\\xa0safety guidance\\xa0on its website that discourages use of its device while operating a moving vehicle.Pointing to a single bullet point buried more than 700 words into a support page that most of its users will never read is an insufficient response to customers misusing the Vision Pro.One doesn’t need spatial computing goggles to envision a deadly accident setting off a firestorm in Washington and drawing more attention to the broader issue of\\xa0distracted driving. That’s a big risk for Apple and its most critical product, the iPhone, as mobile phone use is all but certainly a factor in\\xa0rising roadway deaths.When Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, over 4,600 pedestrians were killed on US roadways, Cambridge Mobile Telematics noted in its latest\\xa0report\\xa0on distracted driving. By 2021, 85% of Americans owned a smartphone and\\xa0almost 7,500\\xa0pedestrians were killed, the most in 40 years.“Drivers are spending more time using their phones while driving and doing it on more trips,” the telematic services provider said in the report. According to its data, drivers interacted with their phones on almost 58% of trips in 2022, up from 54% in 2020. In perhaps the most alarming statistic of all, 34% of phone motion distraction happens above 50 miles per hour.Apple has taken some action, enabling iPhone users to activate a setting aimed at keeping users focused on driving when they’re in a moving car. But the company itself says on its\\xa0support page\\xa0about the feature that it “is not a substitute for following all the rules that prohibit distracted driving.”Apple surely didn’t want these viral videos to distract from the merits of its hot new product. But now that it has, it ought to do more about it.If the iPhone can automatically activate a focus setting when it detects that a user might be driving, Apple ought to equip the Vision Pro with similar capability, at a minimum. While it’s at it, the company should make that automatic activation a standard setting in the iPhone.Buttigieg and NHTSA undoubtedly would welcome Apple and its mobile-device rivals competing to keep drivers’ eyes on the road.You Might Also Like10 features in the Kia EV9 that make you go \\'wow\\'Mercedes-Benz planning new design language for its range of EVs2025 Aston Martin Vantage revealed with huge power boost, spicier style'],\n",

Despite a median annual earning of $44,100 in 2020, $15,500 less than bachelor's degree holders, 28% of associate degree holders earn more than half of bachelor's degree holders. Additionally, industries like construction, manufacturing, and healthcare appreciate the practical training and quick entry into the workforce that associate degree holders offer.\\xa0Speaking of associate degrees, Butler University recently announced a groundbreaking initiative: a two-year, debt-free associate degree program aimed at assisting underserved students. With tuition costs for the 2023-2024 academic year reaching $44,990, this initiative offers students the opportunity to obtain a bachelor's degree from Butler University for $10,000 after completing their associate degree. Set to begin enrolling students for the Fall 2025 semester, the program targets individuals from marginalized backgrounds, including students of color, first-generation college students, and those from low-income households.\\xa0Two most common associate's degrees are the Associate of Arts (AA) and the Associate of Science (AS). The AA degree focuses on liberal arts and humanities subjects like English, history, and psychology, while the AS degree focuses on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields such as biology, chemistry, and computer science.With an Associate of Arts degree, one can pursue various entry-level roles such as administrative assistant, customer service representative, sales associate, office clerk, or social media assistant. However, many Associate of Arts degrees are considered useless.

Leadership development is also prioritized, exemplified by Catalyst, a program grooming recent graduates into area managers, and Leadership Liftoff for new managers.\\xa0One example of an employee joining Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is Fidel Contreras joined the company without a college degree. Motivated by his family's immigrant background and the burden of student debt, Contreras enrolled in a technical learning program with AWS, kickstarting his career in tech at 18. Through hard work and curiosity, Contreras rose to lead a team at AWS.With a growing focus on skills, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has rolled out updated professional training and certifications tailored to meet the increasing demand for skilled IT support and management personnel. With the workforce's growing reliance on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) products like Mac, iPhone, and iPad, the need for proficient IT professionals is at an all-time high.

       "  \"The stock market is one of the best ways to build lasting wealth. That's because over time, the broad S&P 500 has averaged about a 10% yearly return.But if we look back at history, we'll find some businesses that have crushed the market, turning small investments into seven-figure sums. Here's a closer look at Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Costco (NASDAQ: COST), and Home Depot (NYSE: HD), three magnificent consumer stocks that turned $1,000 into more than $1 million.First on this list is the world's most valuable brand. Apple has been a leader when it comes to selling some of the most popular electronics products out there. And this has propelled the FAANG stock 191,000% in the last roughly 43 years, turning $1,000 into $1.9 million today, including dividends.While the iPhone still brings in more than half of the revenue, the business is finding success with other devices, like the MacBook, AirPods, and Watch. Combined, hardware made up 81% of total sales in the fiscal 2024 first quarter.But the software and services division is rapidly ascending to become a more important business driver. Offerings include things like Apple Card, Pay, Music, TV+, iCloud, and advertising. Revenue here was up 11%, higher than the company total. With a gross margin exceeding 70%, services can boost Apple's profitability over time.Investors hoping for similar returns from this business over the next several decades should probably temper expectations. Apple's massive revenue base is struggling to grow at a high rate. Sales dipped 2.8% in fiscal 2023, indicating a mature enterprise.And the current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.3 is very expensive, at least based on the average valuation of the last 10 years. This can also limit forward returns.With trailing-12-month sales of $241 billion, Costco is the world's third-biggest retailer. It operates hundreds of warehouses across the globe, offering shoppers high-quality merchandise at extremely low prices. This business model hasn't changed over the decades.While Costco sounds like a boring company, the returns are exciting. The retail stock is up 123,000% in the last 49 years, including dividends. Even in recent years, shares have crushed the broader market. Gains are buoyed by special one-time payouts, like the $15 dividend announced in December.What separates Costco from a typical retailer is its successful membership model. Consumers must pay annual fees for the right to shop at a warehouse, providing a high-margin and recurring revenue stream. Membership sales were up 8.2% in the last quarter, with a worldwide renewal rate of over 90%.Like Apple, Costco isn't a cheap stock by any means, trading at a P/E multiple of 49.4. This is 47% higher than its trailing-10-year average. Even though there is meaningful growth potential, with management planning to open new stores at a healthy clip, a move that will certainly push up earnings figures, it's not a smart idea to buy the stock today.Another top retailer that turned $1,000 into more than $1 million is Home Depot (NYSE: HD). The home improvement giant's stock has been an even bigger historical winner than Apple or Costco, which you might not expect. Since 1981, Home Depot shares have turned a $1,000 initial capital outlay into a whopping $29.9 million today (including dividends).Similarly to Costco, Home Depot's business hasn't changed much over time. The company sells various tools and supplies through its large stores to do-it-yourself (DIY) and professional customers looking to spruce up their homes. It's a boring business, but the financial results are excellent.Home Depot's operating margin and return on invested capital have averaged 14.2% and 34%, respectively, over the past decade. These metrics are better than the company's key rival, Lowe's. Home Depot's focus on driving efficiencies in its stores by investing in omnichannel capabilities and bolstering the supply chain has helped those metrics.The business is dealing with a bit of a slowdown following strong demand trends during the pandemic. But industry tailwinds favor solid long-term growth. With shares trading at a reasonable P/E ratio of 23.3, investors might want to take a look at the stock.While it's not likely these three companies can repeat their past performances in the future, they are industry leaders that continue to dominate.Should you invest $1,000 in Home Depot right now?Before you buy stock in Home Depot, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Home Depot wasn’t one of them.

       "  'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) made headlines last week with its most significant product launch in almost a decade. On Feb. 2, the company released the Apple Vision Pro, a virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, or \"spatial computer\" as Apple describes it.The new product is equipped with the same chip powering its MacBook Air, allowing the Vision Pro to perform everyday computing tasks such as web browsing, word processing, video editing, and various entertainment tasks.It remains to be seen how successful the headset will be, but this chart shows Apple is currently dedicating about 8% of its annual revenue to research and development. The last time that figure was higher, the tech firm was gearing up to launch the first iPhone. So whatever the company is cooking up now could mean big things for Apple over the next decade.Although the company has encountered some challenges over the last year, its significant cash reserves and potent brand make me confident in its long-term success.Here\\'s why it\\'s not too late to buy Apple stock.Apple hasn\\'t had it easy over the last year. In 2023, macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company, leading to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines.The streak was finally broken in Apple\\'s latest quarter, with revenue rising 2% year over year to $120 billion in the first quarter of 2024. The company beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.However, outperforming estimates wasn\\'t enough to quell investor concern over its iPhone business, with its stock down 3% year-to-date. Smartphone sales rose 6% in Q1 2024, yet fell 13% in China. The East Asian country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening business from Apple\\'s third-largest market. China accounts for about 17% of the company\\'s revenue.Sales in China look unlikely to improve soon or perhaps ever with the rise of rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei. However, growth in other regions could offset losses in China over the long term while the company also gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone. In Q1 2024, product sales in Europe, Apple\\'s second-largest market, posted revenue growth of 10% year over year. Meanwhile, sales in Japan soared 15%.Moreover, despite recent hurdles, Apple\\'s free cash flow climbed 10% to about $107 billion in the last year, indicating slowing Chinese sales aren\\'t having the detrimental effect that the company\\'s stock dip would have you think. Additionally, it shows the firm has the funds to overcome current headwinds and keep investing in other high-growth areas of tech.Apple\\'s research and development hit just under $8 billion last quarter. It\\'s unclear what the tech firm\\'s roadmap looks like for the next decade. However, market trends and the launch of its Vision Pro headset suggest it will include journeying further into artificial intelligence (AI), VR/AR, and digital services. Consistent growth in these sectors could allow Apple to lean less on product sales and, more importantly, the iPhone over the long term.The AI market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, which would see it exceed $1 trillion.

       "  'Once upon a time, believe it or not, no one particularly looked forward to Super Bowl ads.That all changed when Washington faced Los Angeles on Jan. 22, 1984, in Tampa, Fla. Those who tuned in to the big game on CBS — and hadn’t fled to the kitchen for snacks — found themselves watching something completely different.In between ads for Gillette Foamy Gel and Northwestern Mutual insurance, a dystopian scene appeared on their TV sets: A line of men wearing faded gray apparel marched mindlessly into a theater, where a bespectacled face, “Big Brother,” addressed them on a massive screen.Extolling the virtues of groupthink, Big Brother celebrated an imminent victory, free from “pests of any contradictory true thoughts.”Then, the camera cut to a striking blond athlete running in slow motion.Wearing a white tank top and red shorts — and played by British discus thrower and actress Anya Rajah (then Anya Major) — she strode into the theater, with guards in close pursuit. She spun and, with a shout, hurled a sledgehammer at Big Brother’s face. As the screen exploded, large text appeared along with a voice narrating, “On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like \\'1984.\\'”Happy 40th to one of the greatest ads, Super Bowl or otherwise, of all time.Created by the ad agency Chiat/Day and Apple (AAPL), “1984” elevated Super Bowl ads to a whole new level. Today, tech historians, ad pros, and techies alike all look back at the commercial not only as a seminal moment in the democratization of personal computing and Super Bowl advertisements, but as a work of art containing themes that still resonate today.Though Rob Schwartz, an advertising industry leader who ran Chiat/Day from January 2015 to April 2021, was not at the agency when the ad was created, he still still remembers feeling inspired by it when it aired. “It marked the first time that the commercials in the Super Bowl were going to be something else to watch besides the game itself. This marked the moment,” he told Yahoo Finance recently.“It was,” he added, “the first time where the audience went, ‘Wait, wait, wait, don\\'t go to the bathroom. Let\\'s stay and watch a few commercials before the game comes back.\\'\"But Apple, the Super Bowl aside, was in need of a boost.IBM = Big Brother?In the early 1980s, the company had established itself as a promising tech business with products like the Apple II.\\xa0In an attempt to make personal computers more accessible, it had then developed the Lisa,\\xa0named after Steve Jobs’ daughter. Though innovative, the computer had sold poorly, especially compared to IBM’s (IBM) PC, which was released in 1981. Meanwhile, Apple had begun working on the Macintosh, which was meant to accelerate the adoption of the personal computer by the masses.“Apple came into 1984 being walloped by IBM in the personal computing market, and needing a new big hit … the company had bet it all on the Macintosh, spending huge on its R&D, building a new state-of-the-art factory for it,” said Margaret O\\'Mara, the Scott and Dorothy Bullitt chair of American History at the University of Washington.But then arose the question of how to advertise the revolutionary new product. Steve Hayden, now 76, then a copywriter at Chiat/Day, still remembers receiving the assignment from Steve Jobs directly. The young tech visionary reportedly wanted to “stop the world in its tracks” and entrusted the L.A.-based firm with the job.Along with art director Brent Thomas, Hayden began brainstorming. He rifled through old ad concepts he had worked on in San Francisco and found one with the headline \"Why 1984 won\\'t be like \\'1984,\\'\" a line Hayden attributed to fellow Chiat/Day copywriter Gary Gussick. At first, Hayden and Thomas toyed with a comical conception of 1984 “like the Jetsons.” But the ad’s director, a well-known talent by the name of Ridley Scott, had a better idea.“He came and looked at our initial board … he brought in this wonderful coffee table book about the making of Metropolis,\\xa0the movie, and the dramatic huge machines and the interface between humans and these kinds of overwhelming technologies,” Hayden explained. “And so the art direction took a really sharp turn at that point to meet that vision.”The advertising experts had already come up with the Big Brother character and Scott insisted that they introduce another, a heroine who would contrast starkly with the all-male cast and \"break the spell,\" Hayden said.A new ageThe heroine symbolized more than simple rebellion against Big Brother. As historian O’Mara pointed out, the ad aired during the height of the Cold War and year of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. “I think it\\'s telling that she\\'s dressed as a track athlete and dressed as if she\\'s running for the United States,\" she said.The heroine also represented the Macintosh. While computers had previously been monopolized by experts — think mainframes and IBM —\\xa0the Macintosh offered a revolutionary user interface that made personal computers accessible to the mass market.“She was supposed to represent freedom and the dawning of a new age, and therefore, Macintosh,” Hayden said.Added Chiat/Day’s Schwartz: “You have to remember that this was a time when computers were only used for business … When she throws that sledgehammer, she is all of us … and she represents all of us trying to destroy any kind of tyranny or dictatorship, even if it\\'s just a dictator for a day, we don\\'t want that. We want to be free. And I think the power of that is the reason why people talk about it, 40 years later.”But there were some naysayers within the company. Apple\\'s board of directors hated it and almost stopped it from airing. Meanwhile, Hayden himself felt unsure about his work. “I had my own concerns that it might be too foreign in structure and content for an American audience,” he said. “It didn\\'t match the traditional advertising forms.”But Jean-Louis Gassée, now 79, who was then running Apple France, still recalls\\xa0the first time he saw the ad at a 1983\\xa0meeting to prepare for the January launch of the Macintosh. “We had never seen advertising like this ... it was absolutely stunning. And then the lights went up a little bit and from the top of the theater machinery, a Mac came down on a wire, and halfway through the descent it [was amplified by microphones],” he told Yahoo Finance. “So we could hear what became the highly recognizable “bong” of the Mac starting. There was this hysteria in the room.”Though Hayden and the rest of his team at Chiat/Day had never specifically intended “Big Brother” to represent IBM, Jobs quickly adopted that framing. After showing the ad, Jobs gave a “fiery” anti-IBM speech, “saying that the Macintosh would change the world,” according to Gassée. “It was easy at the time to superimpose the Big Brother and the big IBM images.”Holding upIt is actually stunning to watch the ad today and see how it still holds up. Only this time, you can imagine Big Brother appearing on your screen as Tesla’s (TSLA) Elon Musk, Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and the developers of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products.At least Jean-Louis Gassée sees it that way. He asserted that the ad is still relevant as we grapple with the likes of AI and user privacy in the world of Facebook and Google. It serves as “a good way to remind us of the necessary fight between established powers and upstarts.”He added: “I think the ad presents two views of technology. One that is Big Brother-like, oppressive, and one which is the Macintosh, a way to break through the domination of Big Brother technology.” he said. “So this ad in 1983, 1984, presented a view of the conflict between usages of technology. I think that that conflict is still alive.”Enjoy the Super Bowl.Dylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter.'],\n",

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley analyst, Jason Moser. Jason, how's your Monday going so far?Jason Moser: Hey, so far so good it's nice weather out there. How about you, Deidre?Deidre Woollard: I'm loving our weather, but I'm thinking about our people in California who are having a bit of a tough weather time.Jason Moser: Yeah. Cancel the final round of the Pebble Beach prom out there in California on Monterey. When the weather's that bad, you need to take note.Deidre Woollard: Yeah, absolutely. Well, let's get into what's happening with the markets. Last week, big week, we had Meadow, we had Amazon, we had Apple, and mostly a pretty great week. This week we've got probably more earnings, but a wide variety of large company and maybe not your ones that are at the top of market moving, but really important to cover, one of them, McDonald's, you got to talk about McDonald's.Jason Moser: Absolutely.Deidre Woollard: Of course. I would say looking at the headlines versus look at the actual earnings sales, if you look at the headlines, it's going to be companies missing revenue targets. But I look at it., companies still able to deliver comparable sales, that increase every quarter at about a little over 4% in sales growth in the US in this quarter. Don't you think that sometimes McDonald's deserves a little more respect than it sometimes gets?Jason Moser: I absolutely do. One of the reasons why I feel that way Deidre is because in my early days here, when I first got here at the Fool, McDonald's was the company I looked at and didn't give it that credit that it deserved. I thought, you what? That's yesterday's news, and people don't want McDonald's, now they're going to Starbucks and they're going to Chipotle or whoever. No, McDonald's absolutely deserves a ton of credit.I'm not a big McDonald's guy myself these days but it's impossible to ignore the success that this company has had over the course of its existence. It's easy I think to view it as perhaps an older or more challenged brand here domestically particularly, but I think when you look at the numbers, they say otherwise and this is a company that still has a ton of brand equity globally. Just having had the experience of traveling and living overseas for several years, I definitely, saw that, I've seen that. You brought up the comps numbers, I think it's absolutely worth mentioning, US comps this quarter were up 4.3%, international operated markets up 4.4%. Their developmental markets they saw under performance there. A lot of that, they said, reflected the impact of the war going on in the Middle East right now and that's very understandable and there's some second order impacts that come from that as well. You got to give them a little bit of a pass on that, that's just something that's completely out of their control, like the weather so to speak. But when you look at shareholders who've held onto these shares over the last decade, this stock has returned 300%. Well ahead of the markets performance there. You attribute it to that brand equity I think but also it's a franchise model that's tremendous. They've got 40,000 plus restaurants, 95% of those are franchised. That doesn't gin up a ton on the top line compared to something a company owned operation like Chipotle for example. But what it enables them to do is really bring some impressive profitability down to the bottom line. You put that all together and just it's not a surprise to me to see McDonald's perform so well, but, it's one of those companies I think that a lot of people just, they'll look at it and just just keep on walking.Deidre Woollard: I think it's true and you mentioned the franchises. I love to mention that it's always that it's a stealth real estate company. They own all of that land and that's very valuable and a good part of the company. But I wanted to talk a little bit about what you said there about the US. I feel there is that perception that people don't go to McDonald's, but then you look at their loyalty program. You've got 150 million members that have been active in the last 90 days, so that's huge. Twenty billion in sales in 2023 and I the way that they're pivoting things, they're constantly tweaking things. We think of them as burgers, the Big Mac they're making, the double Big Mac now. But chicken is as big as a sales driver for them and they're seeing that globally and they're trying to figure out, more of the world is interested in eating a chicken sandwich versus a burger, so how do we make a better chicken sandwich?. Now they're taking on coffee. It started with, it's just a cheaper way to get coffee in the morning, you get it, with your breakfast, that's great. But they're tweaking this too in interesting ways. I don't know, I the way they use data a lot.Jason Moser: I do too. In this age of AI, we talk a lot about AI and all of the potential that it offers. Really the lifeblood of AI ultimately it's data, and we've seen these companies from Chipotle to Starbucks and everywhere in between utilizing these loyalty programs to really take advantage of getting as much customer data as they possibly can. What that ultimately does, it enables these companies to keep their customers within that universe and then cater offering specifically to those individual customers. I think we've seen the investments in technology really pay off as well. It makes me think of companies like Domino's and Papa John's. No, maybe those are the pizza concepts that many might have at the top of their list, given some of the local choices that exist where they may live, but the bottom line is they're very convenient, they're wonderful options and I have to tell you the investments in technology, they make it so easy to order. They have loyalty programs that keep you coming back for more and McDonald's absolutely taking advantage of that same dynamic. To your point on the chicken, I think that's important. In this age, we've really seen Chick-Fill-A take off and I think a lot of companies are trying to figure out ways to compete with a Chick-Fill-A chicken. Absolutely, a ton of growth there and I was reading through the call and the investments in the time McDonald's was put into this McCrispy chicken sandwich, it's really resulted in some serious drives to the business. They're talking about this is scaled to a one billion dollar brands across 30 markets worldwide. But now they also mentioned that chicken category represents $25 billion in annual system wide sales, which essentially puts it on par with beef, their beef offerings and they're sitting there also making these investments in making their burgers better as well at the same time. It does feel like while there's a ton of brand equity and a lot that they could probably just hit cruise control and just keep on moving forward, they don't seem to want to rest on their laurels. It's refreshing, I think, to see a concept like McDonald's really trying to up its game and compete with a lot of these fast-casual competitors out there today.Deidre Woollard: Well, and they've had some swings that have missed in the past. We talked a little bit about Starbucks. McDonald's has this new concept, the cosmic, it's this cold coffee drinks and they've just tested it out, I think in about ten locations. Traffic's been pretty strong so far. Then I was listening to the Starbucks call last week and they were talking about the need to try to get people there in the afternoons. It seems like this afternoon thing is interesting, but I'm wondering. McDonald's has the room to play with things like this, but what do you think about that concept? Would you be driving through the Cosmics to get yourself an afternoon drink?Jason Moser: If I was going by one, probably, I don't know that I'd go out of my way. But it also could be if I was going by one and I went by there once, maybe I would find it compelling and want to go out of my way for future trips. But I think it's important to note this Cosmic's offering. They identified. This $100 billion category. They quote across their top six markets that really focus on these beverages. It's not just beverages. If you look at the Cosmic menu, it is more than just beverages. Honestly, hey, listen, I could see those McPops doing pretty well. I don't know if you haven't seen them check that menu. The McPops look pretty good. But I absolutely love that they're trying this because again, I think in many cases, it's a matter of convenience. If they present a good offering and it's convenient, then people are going to give it a shot. If we look back through the history of something like a Starbucks, for example, that's a company that has started to recognize the benefits of convenience and incorporating more things like drive-throughs into their restaurants. McDonald's, I think has always been really known for, low prices convenience. This is something where they really specialize, and now they're starting to make that progress or that leap up into bringing a little bit more quality they're offering. Again, I think that menu with Cosmics, it's compelling, it's different, it's not just McDonald's. I think that will lead a lot of people to give it a shot. Then it's a matter of whether they find it compelling enough to keep going back.Deidre Woollard: Well, and I think there's a whole new category emerging like Starbucks is trying to get people there for the drink and the snack. Other companies are starting to make these like later offerings that you come in for the drink in the snack option, especially in the afternoons. It reminds me a little bit of when they were trying to make, I think it was Taco Bell. They tried to make like a fourth meal. [LAUGHTER] I feel like they're trying to make another meal in here.Jason Moser: It's the fourth or fifth meal, but it's at a different time of day. I think this is probably the time of day that more people can relate to. Because I think the fourth meal was probably geared toward people who have been out really late at night and have the munchies maybe on the way home. This seems like it's geared toward a little bit of a different audience and probably a bigger audience for that matter.Deidre Woollard: Yeah, so thinking about Starbucks and McDonald's, the role of China is huge. Both of them are thinking about China. Late last year, McDonald's, they increased their minority stake in China to 48%. They opened 1,000 new restaurants, or actually a little over that last year in China all-time high. It's a pretty small percent of the business. But how are you thinking about companies that have this large consumer exposure in China right now? Because we've got geopolitical concerns there as well as some consumer weakness.Jason Moser: Yeah, I think of the grand scheme of things, I view it ultimately as a positive, and I've said it before. When it comes to investing in China, I know what I don't know, investing in pure-play China just doesn't work for me. I've watched a play out over the last 15 years in how so much of this hype ends up sputtering out. With exceptions of course, but for the most part, it's just been a very difficult market to fully understand and I think really, honestly have faith in. But I think I view these multinationals, Starbucks, McDonald's, Apple, Coca-Cola, you name it. These are great ways to get satisfactory exposure to China without actually having to worry so much about the minutia. Not having to worry so much about what's going on over there. When you look at the state of the Chinese consumer today, I know things aren't all that great right now. I think there's reason to be hopeful though that the Chinese consumer will start seeing better days sooner rather than later. There's a lot of pessimism out there. Challenges from the COVID policies, and ongoing property crisis, that was a real 12 punch. High rates of youth unemployment, poor economic forecasts, you get the collapse of Evergreen. All of these things put together is there's just a ton of pessimism out there in regard to the Chinese consumer today. I think that's precisely when investors need to start looking because we know that things eventually will improve. Perhaps we're getting a little bit closer. For me, the ideal way to participate in an economy like that is going to be through the multinationals like your McDonald's and Starbucks of the world.Deidre Woollard: Yeah. With McDonald's, you get a nice little dividend along the way.Jason Moser: That's a very good point.Deidre Woollard: Well, I want to pivot and talk about something else that is on my mind this morning. Did you watch the Grammys?Jason Moser: I must admit I did not.Deidre Woollard: Well, there was this commercial that caught my attention outside of the other controversies that may have caught my attention. It was this Snap commercial taking aim at TikTok and Instagram reels and basically saying social media is bad. Snapchat is good. It's this fun, happy place. We've got these like, oh look, I'm a broccoli face. It's interesting they had this big ads bend last night. They've got this new campaign. Then this morning they cut about 10% of their global workforce. They're reporting tomorrow. But I'm thinking about where they're taking their strategy. There was this leaked email last year that said that Evans Bagel sent out the CEO. Social media is dead, long live Snapchat. You talked about Meta on Friday on the show. Certainly, that is going nowhere from what I can see and from the earnings last week. But is there a case for the idea that social isn't quite as social anymore?Jason Moser: I think there is to an extent. I think social is going to be with us in one form or another going forward. At least I'm going to have to imagine for the rest of my life. I think it's ultimately just a matter of what people are looking to get out of it. I do understand if folks are pulling back on the rains a little bit and maybe not being quite as social or sharing quite as much, we've seen that that stuff can certainly be used against you. It is absolutely impossible for me to buy into the notion that Meta is on the win. The portfolio of that strategy for them has really paid off, and we just saw that in spades here in the most recent core. Snap I think is in a little bit of a bind because they still really are just Snapchat. Up and coming generation likely isn't looking at it with the same rose-colored glasses that the previous one did. When you look at the numbers, revenue growth has hit a wall. Again, like you said, Meta's report tells us there's still plenty of growth out there to be had. I was interested to look at Snap and compare it to Twitter at a certain point of time to get an idea of where these two businesses were. You look at Twitter, which was acquired in the back half of 2022. But if you look at Twitter's revenue in 2022, they generated a little bit better than $5 billion in revenue, and Snap still hasn't even gotten there, and that's Twitter. A company that I think many would argue myself included, left a ton of money on the table for just a number of various self-inflicted reasons. There are some lessons learned from Twitter to me, Snap rhymes. I think when you look at the overall opportunity out there, shoot, Amazon ad revenues up 27% of the quarter. That advertising revenue is definitely out there. It's companies like Snap I think are having a little bit of a more difficult time realizing it these days because social is such a difficult space when you're competing against Meta. But I think the question really for Snap investors at this point is, what are you ultimately expecting from this company? Do you think it's going to grow or is this something else? Do you feel like it's going to be acquired? Because I think the growth question is a very fair one, particularly given what we've just seen play out here in the early parts of emergencies.Deidre Woollard: Well, thanks for breaking down with me today, Jason.Jason Moser: Thank you.Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey, co-host of Motley Fool Money Here.

Ricky Mulvey caught up with Patrick Badolato, an Associate Professor of Instruction at the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business, to discover what investors can find out beyond the headlines and in the footnotes.Ricky Mulvey: We talk a lot about headlines coming out of earnings, the big reporting numbers. But right now you want to focus on the footnotes. These are at the bottom of the page as we go through earning season, why are the footnotes even worth an investor's time to check out?Patrick Badolato: Sure, Ricky, I love that question and let me step back real quickly which is I'm going to refer to the footnotes as like all of the broad, qualitative, sometimes quantitative information that's in addition to the financial statements. Not what's on the financial statements, not the main core financial metrics, but I think they're massively informative because they give additional insight and flavor and sometimes really critical details about updates and changes that it's just we're going to be more informed walking into earning season or really any other assessment of a company if we've spent a little bit of time. My class, I used the phrase, read good but spend the time to avail yourself to the footnotes, the other information outside of the financial statements because it's packed full of useful Tibbets of information.Ricky Mulvey: Sometimes they can be hard to parse through if you're not an accounting professor. Sometimes there's some gold in there. We're trading emails before this and you said there was a classic example from Apple.Patrick Badolato: Yes, let your first point I want to address and I want to give the Apple example but that's the big challenge which is like, 10K is what, 120 pages long, and that's one pre IPO filing something the same. Most of it, so much of it is too much of it, if I can give my opinion is boilerplate where you're reading stuff and I'm not really changing anything. The challenge is though, the nuggets and the insights are there, they're just not easy to find and yes, I'm an accounting professor, I like reading these things and I'll put my time into reading the whole thing. But it's what I try to convey in a class and I want to use the Apple example is what I teach even at the Intro Financial Accounting level, is the footnotes are there and at times you want to grab them to think about it. The classic one I've done over time and this is not specifically recent news, but Apple's got a great footnote on its accounts receivable and that has nothing to do with what's reported on the balance sheet. It's just there's a footnote that talks about it. I think it's page 40 of their 2022,1K and they give a comment to the effect that what they're doing is they're requiring all smaller scale retailers to go out and get like third party insurance so that Apple will sell to them on account. But the reality is that the retailer has to go and get backing so that if the small retailer is not able to pay Apple, Apple is still going to collect effectively insurance proceeds so they're going to get their cash either way. The footnote shows us that, like Apple has virtually no risk of collection with its account receivable reported on the balance sheet, not on the balance sheet. There's nothing about that there. Read the footnote and you realize maybe that's something you would expect for a behemoth like Apple but really no risk of collection given the way they structure their deals with any smaller retailer.Ricky Mulvey: Is that something that's rare among companies? I could imagine a lot of companies, they want to get the cash that they're entitled to on that account. But I don't know of any other companies that do that.Patrick Badolato: Yes. Great question. I wish I had a better answer and I don't like how many use it, how many don't? I worry that the classic answer is just like, well Apple could do it at once because it's in such a position of strength. But I'll give you a personal finance example of this that I usually try to talk about in class which is, this is very similar to what we may face when we're getting a mortgage with PMI or private mortgage insurance. The bank's going to require us. We put less than 20% down to go pay for PMI insurance or private mortgage insurance. If that's so that the bank still collects its mortgage payments effectively, if we were to fall or miss a payment or something like that and it's crazy to think about it but it's similar, whether it's like you have one very powerful player, the bank giving us a mortgage and one far less powerful entity, us, the homeowner and the argument is you're going to basically make the smaller player pay the insurance to protect the larger player. That's what Apple's doing a version of that with its accounts receivable, ensuring it collects.Ricky Mulvey: When you're one of the biggest companies on the planet, it's easy to know that other companies need you more than perhaps you need it. Uber is reporting tomorrow. This is a more recent example. Last year, the company changed how it treats discounts and promotions. We're talking about it. I think you said this was an important change, so what happened? What they do?Patrick Badolato: I think for this one, it's worth stepping back again and talking about the way they laid things out with their initial IPO filed in 2019 and there's a lot of layers and there was a lot of conversations but I want to just get to the point which is, they did not call. If you've taken Uber, you've got Uber eats delivered or you've taken a ride to go somewhere with Uber, I certainly have done that but we are not Uber's customer. In their IPO, we were not their customer. We were called riders or end users. Their customer, consistent with their IPO document was the driver, the driver driving the car providing transportation and that may seem weird, but that's the genesis of this whole idea. In their IPO, they had a bunch of promotions and discounts that were issued to the rider or the end user and they were actually booking that as both revenue and then offsetting it with sales and marketing expense. I think it was rounds to $3,000,000,000 in 2017 and 2018 combined in the two years preceding their IPO. But $3,000,000,000 and I'm not this is legal, there's a way that this works out it's because the riders were not their customers. But to simplify it, maybe over simplified. It's similar to saying that they were effectively buying their own services and that's what it works out to. If they gave a ride or $120 coupon, that $20 coupon was counting as revenue. It was removed via sales and marketing expense so no effect on like operating income but still an opportunity to increase revenue, to boost the revenue growth in the early stages of the company.Ricky Mulvey: Now the revenue is not comparable and maybe you'll even see a slight revenue decline as they make this change. Why do you think Uber is making it?Patrick Badolato: Yes, and so let's just be specific about the change too but then I definitely want to offer some lens into what we can think about before the 2023 earnings come out. What they changed in the second quarter of 2023. I actually think based on the numbers, it was like toward the end of the second quarter, but I don't know the exact date. But they changed in the second quarter of 2023, is in many of their major markets, it looks like it's roughly two thirds using the third quarter numbers, but they now are classifying the rider effectively as a customer. As they're classifying the writer as a customer now, that actually means that if they give promotions and discounts, which they're continuing to do, it's not a removal of promotions and discounts, but now they're not counting the promotions and discounts as revenue and they're also not offsetting it as a marketing sales and marketing expense. Ricky you already alluded to this, and I just want to flesh it out a bit more. The challenge here is this change occurred mid year, roughly. It's going to be hard to compare anything coming out tomorrow with 2023's numbers, with anything that happened in 2022 or any prior years. Even within 2023 because the change didn't happen at the beginning, it might be hard to think about quarter to quarter comparisons or year over year comparisons. In this case to reiterate your point, revenue will actually be smaller because they're not including, and I think in quarter three it was $521 million. That just one quarter $521 million that would have been in revenue is not there and also is going to be removed from sales and marketing expense. The year over year revenue growth, all else held equal is going to be lower. It's just going to be harder to achieve any growth because stuff that was classified in revenue is no longer classified that way.Ricky Mulvey: Maybe there's a tide to the story where Kashrashahi he comes in as the CEO of Uber, wanting a leaner, more focused company and maybe take away some of that noise in the S1. I know we've made fun of it on the show in the years past. The total addressable market was four billion people, or basically everybody in the 63 countries that it operated in at the time. Do you think that with this move in the footnotes, the way that Uber is changing the way it counts revenue, is that part of the story here with the company as it is today?Patrick Badolato: I love that question and I want to elaborate on it. But I think there's one more level and I hate to be nip picky about this too.Ricky Mulvey: Go for it. You're the professor.Patrick Badolato: That sales and marketing expense is also going to go down. I just caution, it's not a criticism of Uber in any way, but just preparing us for what we're going to see is that year over year sales and marketing expense should also decrease using the third quarter number alone by that 521 million. It'll be more than that because we don't have the fourth quarter information yet. But the sales and marketing expense will decrease as a dollar amount and also will decrease as a percent of revenue. I mentioned that we're going to see like margin improvement, where one expense decreases as a percent of revenue. It's not good nor bad. It's just a result of this reporting change. Worth being informed when we walk in there because we don't want to be saying is, wow, look at this great efficiency improvement with sales and marketing. They must be getting better at promotions and discounts or marketing. I'm not in any way saying they're getting worse. But no, the data just mathematically will lead to sales and marketing expense decreasing as a percent of revenue. That's like efficiency. That's worth understanding the reporting behind. But Ricky, I love your other question. I want to flush it out a bit more as well. I was pretty critical, looking at Uber in the pre IPO stage and we've done a bunch of classes and offering that there's a lot of questions and confusion and seem like distractions. Then COVID hits and just up ends everything. Which, you know, is tough for so many different companies.But I think the Uber that emerge, it's really fascinating business model and I think they've figured out what they are, the phrase I use and I talk about them in classes, this is not a replacement for individual car ownership. This is not a target market of four billion people, but what they are is a platform of convenience. A company that can offer us rides when we need rides, can offer us goods. I applaud the fact that Uber eats has become so inclusive of not just fast food, restaurant meals, but you can get delivered groceries and florists and all these other things, which I think makes it more convenient for the customer. But also a better, driving opportunity, better utilization for the driver. I think that focus on the core and getting away from the autonomous and the replacement for individual car ownership is a massive step in the direction. Still questions, still stuff to figure out. But that core competency, the platform of convenience, we like convenience, we like stuff, we like getting places and getting things delivered to us. That may be a successful move in many ways for them. It seems like it is.Ricky Mulvey: Maybe you're checking out the footnotes in a report. I think one piece of research you shared with me that is worth investors attention though, that they can track for the companies that they own and follow is the risk factors and an annual report. There are some researchers that found that how companies management changes the risk factors and changing their wording can often predict maybe future trouble for the company. And that section is worth a little bit more attention.Patrick Badolato: I agree. I say that my thoughts on reading the literature and everything, it seems like reading the footnotes is still not that commonplace, full of information. But I love teaching it because, hey, that's your possible chance for differentiation. The change in the language, what's there. I agree, sometimes the risk can be informative. I love the way they were looking at it in that study, but I'll offer a few other areas I think are worth checking out. We gave the specific discounts and promotions and sales and marketing with Uber. But some other ones I strongly recommend is first and foremost actually owner rank this, the segments. Look at the segments of the business. Segments move in different directions. This is true for Uber. Their freight segment during 2023 has been going down year over year decline in revenue growth. Where deliveries and mobility, those are growing at different rates. Companies have segments that don't just do one thing, read as much as you can off the income statement or the financial statements to find out about segments. Another one, is MDNA management discussion and analysis. They don't always give you everything you need, but often there's that movement, Hey, here's factors that contributed to a trend. Factors that offset. Granular data that gives us a little bit more about like, let me know a bit about the story behind it. Revenue recognition, which I would argue is massively important for Uber and it's S1 are realizing wait, who's their customer? How do you do this? Then if you have companies with revenue recognized over time or have some discretion on are they the agent in the transaction or are they the main provider? There's more there as well. Risks looking at debt footnotes can be certainly informative in cases like Silicon Valley Bank and others. Taxes in certain cases. Really try to figure out what's valuable for the company and then use the footnotes is like, hopefully, you're thirsty for. I want to get more information. I want to get granular data on what's there.Ricky Mulvey: Patrick Badolato is a Professor of accounting and finance at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas.

I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me in the studio, Motley Fool senior analysts, Jason Moser and Bill Mann. Gentlemen, great to have you both here.Bill Mann: That's true.Dylan Lewis: We've got earnings updates from Big Tech, two stories that have us checking in on the panic meter and insights from a CEO that's led his company and shareholders to 3000% returns in his tenure. We're going to kick off with the Big Tech bid. Massive week for earnings, we have updates from Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and more. Jason, growth is back at the second largest company in the world. Apple reported top-line growth for the first time in over a year in its holiday quarter results, what got the company back on track?Jason Moser: I feel like that second largest company was a little bit of a jazz.Dylan Lewis: It's a little dig.Jason Moser: Listen, these things come in waves. I think with Apple, relative to the other big this was an OK quarter. Nothing special, but it was good. I think the bigger question really is probably focused more on what do things look going forward. I mean, looking at the numbers, they did return to revenue growth up 2% for the quarter with earnings per share up 16%, so obviously taking advantage of that scale. When you break it out into segment, iPhone revenue was up 6%, Mac revenue basically flat, iPad down 25%, wearables, home, and accessories down 11%, and then services up at 11%. We're seeing more and more. We talk about Apple becoming the services company that continues to a degree and it is important because that services revenue is so much higher margin than the hardware. To the tune of about 2x. Basically double the gross margin of that hardware. Still big questions there in regard to China. China down 13% for the quarter, so I think all in all the tepid response from investors makes a lot of sense given that the future does. It's not so clear right now.Dylan Lewis: I feel like we've been watching this services increase as a portion of the revenue for a while, but it feels an awful lot trying to change the direction of cruise ship bill. It's just such a big company.Bill Mann: Well, I just wanted to ask Jason, if you could get into the heads of leadership, Tim Cook, would they get out of hardware if they could just be a services business at Apple?Jason Moser: Well, I can't imagine that given how well they do hardware. That's just something that they're so well known for, but clearly, they are trying to steer this more and more in that services direction which makes a lot of sense.Bill Mann: I agree. I view the hardware as being their Mot.Dylan Lewis: We did get an update on their hardware offerings or at least we finally have hands on their latest hardware offering. Their Vision Pro is officially on sale this week, Jason. It costs $3500.Bill Mann: That's not on sale. That is full price.Dylan Lewis: It's available for purchase, I should say. What does this device mean for Apple?Jason Moser: Well, this is just the first step. I don't think it means a lot at least in the near term. This is the first step for them, and I think what will be a multi years and potentially really multi decades effort. If you listen to Tim Cook, he says the Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of innovation. It's years ahead of anything else. I don't know that necessarily buy into the years ahead of everything else. It wasn't a form factor to me. It's the same as all of the others, and that to me is the biggest sticking point with all of these, whether it's Oculus or Vision Pro or whatever else. The problem is you got to get the device built first to figure out what exactly you can do with it, and I think that's what we're going to see over the course of the next several years and beyond. It's ultimately these companies trying to figure out what they can do with these devices, why we need them as consumers, and then absolutely they need to continue to work on bringing that form factor down because to me that's the biggest roadblock with all of this. Not just Apple, but with any company that's getting into this headset space. That form factor has got to change or there's no massive option.Dylan Lewis: We're going to stay in the metaverse and check in on Meta. Company also reported this week, shares up 20% after we saw full year results. We got the standard updates from the company, but also a big time surprise, a dividend.Jason Moser: Zuckerberg giving himself a little raise there.Bill Mann: He's getting a little bump, a little $175 million per quarter given his current share count. If you annualize that, which you should do, that's $700 million a year, which is pretty good.Dylan Lewis: If you don't own quite as many shares as Mark Zuckerberg, you'll be getting $0.50 per share.Bill Mann: What do you make most of us by the way.Dylan Lewis: Jason, what do you make of this capital allocation decision?Jason Moser: It's OK. I don't mind it. It certainly is a nice diversion away from the cash incinerator. That is Reality Labs, and so that's good. Look, you look at the business and what they tried to do in 2023, the year of efficiency. Well, I think so. They saw a 10% point bounce in operating margin from 25% last year to 35% this year, so they really did deliver on that year of efficiency, but even more encouraging is now we're seeing the business start to turn back around on the revenue side. The advertising demand that obviously remains there. Three plus billion users around the world. Listen, they grew that advertising revenue. They grew that revenue 25% with expenses along the way coming down 8%. Earnings per share are better than 200%. You know the one thing that stood out to me on the release and we knew this was happening head count down 22%.Bill Mann: Incredible.Jason Moser: On the one hand, you have to ask the question, why did you, why were you so bloated to begin with? Well, they weren't the only ones. I think we've seen this all across the market, but it just really stood out to me. They brought their head count at 22% clearly playing a role in the cost structure.Dylan Lewis: It seems like a fitting time to check in on Meta because Facebook turns 20 this weekend. Back then it was the Facebook, now it is Meta gone through a couple name changes along the way, and we've seen the business change, and I think one thing that was a little buried in the results that we saw in some of the commentary from management was a bit of a transition away from a focus on the legacy, what was namesake platform Facebook, and much more of a portfolio view of the business, Jason.Jason Moser: I think you look at the name Meta Platforms. They really are just trying to communicate that we are a platform with a number of different properties. As these companies get bigger and they have more contributors to the top and bottom lines, they don't necessarily need to be so granular. We saw Apple do the same thing back in the day in regard to the numbers of devices that they were reporting this to me. It really does make a lot of sense just given where Facebook is as big as the user base is today with Meta platforms.Bill Mann: I think the dividend itself and the reduction in headcount both have something to do with each other because you've come to a time in which money is no longer free, and they're sitting on $65 billion in cash that is unencumbered. It's just sitting there, and they have come to the realization that, yes, as a platform company, they've needed to rationalize some of the investments that they've made. I do think it's funny at this point that this company is called Meta, and they barely talked about the metaverse. It would be like a company called Buggy Whip Incorporated beating up $200 billion in a day.Jason Moser: I think that's the biggest question in regard to Reality Labs in the metaverse aspiration. I mean, reality lives chalking up another $4.6 billion loss for the quarter not for the year, $4.6 billions of the quarter. It made me think of Amazon back in the day, and we could be very critical of Amazon and all of their investments and just perpetuating losses, but it was an easier leap at least then because you know that people are going to buy stuff, and we could see the clear trend that people were buying more and more online. Here I just, I'm not saying it's not going to happen, but it definitely requires a greater leap of faith for investors to believe that the metaverse will develop into something. It just really hasn't yet not for the masses. That's the big question mark, but they're going to keep on investing.Bill Mann: The thing that you have to know about Mark Zuckerberg is that he's not a romantic, and so when things are not working he is going to cut and he's going to change, and I think that is to his credit as CEO.Dylan Lewis: On that note, I want to put a reckless prediction over to you, Bill. Will Meta still be called Meta in five years?Bill Mann: No, I don't think so. I mean there's the Berkshire Hathaway example where the Berkshire Hathaway is actually named after a failed investment. It should be platforms or Reality Labs, but, no, I don't think it will be.Dylan Lewis: We're going to wrap the segment. Checking in on Microsoft, we have results from the newly crowned largest company in the world, Jason, and they seemed awfully strong.Jason Moser: Dig number 2. Yes, very strong. The big takeaway for investors. Microsoft is absolutely seen as the leader in the AI space, at least in regard to the big three or big four. Nvidia is just in a world of their own, so I don't include them there, but when you talk about companies like Amazon, and Alphabet, and Meta, and Microsoft, Microsoft is just seen as the leader right now, and they do so many things well, beyond that I mean productivity, storage, developers, security, and now gaming. Listen, they closed that Activision Blizzard deal and that gives them $13 billion plus gaming franchises. This is a monster in the gaming space. I just don't think you can forget about that, but they grew revenue 16% excluding currency effects, cloud revenue up 24%, these guys just keep on getting it done.Bill Mann: I love the fact that we're shoehorning in a $3 trillion company like right at the end.Jason Moser: Speak in right before we go to break status quo.Dylan Lewis: Speaking of after break, we've got one more update from Big Tech and a closer look at some of the headlines that might be scarier than they actually are. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money.Dylan Lewis: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis joined in studio by Bill Mann and Jason Moser. We hit Apple, Microsoft, and Meta updates, but we can't leave Amazon out of the big tech party. Jason, the Cloud was a huge focus for Microsoft. When we saw results from Amazon. How are things looking over at AWS?Jason Moser: I think this quarter really pulled back the curtain on how well diversified this business has become AWS revenue because that mean a AWS, that's really the first thing we focus on now. Revenue, $24.2 billion. That was up 13% from a year ago with operating income up 38% operating margin in that cloud division 29.6%. That was up 500 basis points from a year ago. All things considered, AWS continues to, as Ron Gross might say, fire on L cylinders. But back to the diversification of this business, look at the other parts of it, advertising up 26%. They are really seeing a lot of benefit from building out that entertainment aspect, that entertainment side of the business. Then of course, the retail operations continue to kill it, growth spread out equally between US and international. One little snippet I thought was interesting because we know how important third party sellers are to Amazon. Worldwide third party seller unit mix was 61% this quarter, its highest ever.Bill Mann: You don't want to see a company cost cut its way to success and in fact, that's a hard way for companies to tend to do. Because you always want to go back and say, well, if you're cost cutting now, does that mean that you were lacking discipline before? But this quarter also had, for Amazon, the rocket fuel of a reduction in overhead so they had great online sales growth. But the reduction in cost primarily at their central operations really fueled an unbelievable quarter.Dylan Lewis: So much of the theme in 2023 with big tech and companies in general was the year of efficiency. Meta got the branding on that, but we saw it across the board really with the companies focusing on their capital allocation and where they're putting money to work. Looking at what we're seeing, Bill so far from big tech and the market's reaction to the big tech results, what are we zeroing in on here?Bill Mann: I think one of the more interesting things is the fact that Meta decided to declare a dividend and the market is reacting positively to it. Which is the opposite of what happened when Microsoft did a few years ago. People were like, well, don't you have more places you can put your money? Efficiency does, if you are doing it right, leave money to be allocated in a different way. We talked about this last week about how Microsoft is now $468 per man, woman and child on the planet. They are not necessarily going to become more valuable, increasing their revenues across the board as they will be more efficient going forward.Dylan Lewis: Jason, any other takeaways as we put all the big tech results together?Jason Moser: I think when you look at big tech particularly, I'm thinking Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. There was some language in a lot of these calls and I'll call out something just from Amazon's call. This is in regard to Cloud, while cost optimization continued to attenuate, larger new deals also accelerated. Ultimately, I think this has broader implications beyond just these three companies. I think it's a sign that, that spend may be coming back around for a lot of these enterprises based on the language in these calls. I think that is certainly something that should play out as a nice tail win for big tech, but also a lot of their customers which represents some great investing opportunities as well.Dylan Lewis: In addition to the usual earnings updates this week, some pockets of concerns with a couple stories and Bill, Jason, I wanted to get your take on where these rank on the panic meter. First up, shares of New York Community Bancorp down 40% this week after the company reported rising losses and cut its dividend. Bill, the regional banking issues of 2023 still very fresh in a lot of people's minds. Is this something people need to be concerned about?Bill Mann: Well, yes and no. This is a rather big bank. It is an interesting story because New York Community Bancorp was the company that bought the assets from Signature Bank, which failed basically due to their ownership in crypto when crypto collapsed. How would you like to be a bank director now having to explain that you've lost money off of buying something at a discount that's already taken down other banks?Dylan Lewis: It's not great. Sounds like an easy conversation to have.Bill Mann: They did it. Why shouldn't we? It's going to work for somebody someday. It was a bad quarter for them. It also is a little bit of a recognition of the fact that they have a huge amount of exposure to commercial real estate. I don't know if you've heard this, but a lot of offices and a lot of places still aren't full. There have been a huge amount of bankruptcies in the commercial space. I think ultimately the reality for New York Community Bank is that nobody really focused on their need to raise their provisions for credit losses sooner, so they did it all at once.Dylan Lewis: Jason, this is a literal leveling up of the requirements for this business. Does it seem like something where management is maybe a little bit behind but being prudent here?Jason Moser: I would hope that's the case. I certainly understand the near term concerns in this situation. You've got a bank now, that's all of a sudden it's going to be lofted into this category for banking. These are the biggest of the bigs. There's a lot that comes with that, enhanced financial standards and reporting. They have to really rebuild this business. That takes time and capital. I certainly understand, cutting that dividend. It's nice that they've at least still maintained it. I understand concerns when you're building up allowances for credit losses. But, hey, listen, they grew tangible book value from a year ago so that's encouraging. There are a lot of unknowns when it comes with some of these deals. But I don't know that I really see this as something to be worried about longer term. But by the same token, I get the short term concerns.Bill Mann: It didn't happen from nowhere.Dylan Lewis: Bill, I want to give you the final take there. Is this really something that we should be zeroing on specifically to New York Community Bank, or is this something we should be watching for the industry?Bill Mann: Their net interest margin collapsed this last quarter and I think that it is specific to New York Community Bancorp. The analysts on the call were absolutely withering with the fact that the changes and the set asides that they made were so big. That why is it that you haven't been able to predict this? By the way, how about some good predictions now for what's going forward now that you've done this. I think it is specific to them, but you're talking about something that's happening in an environment around the world, where commercial real estate is a financial problem. If those are the assets on your balance sheet, you should at some level be worried.Dylan Lewis: You teed me up better than you possibly could have known for our second topic for the panic meter. This zooms in on real estate, but takes us outside the United States and usually I go global when I've got you on the show, Bill. This week, a judge in China ruled that failed real estate giant Evergran will move to liquidation. This is a story we've been following for a little bit, dating back to the company originally defaulting on its dollar denominated debt. How big of a deal is this, Bill?Bill Mann: It's huge in a lot of ways. It's huge. Let's start with the top number. They owe somebody $300 billion. [laughs] I don't know if you know that, but that's a lot.Dylan Lewis: That's a huge chunk of change.Bill Mann: A bankruptcy judge actually in Hong Kong said, fine. You've been trying to figure out how to reorganize. We're done with this, so now, we're going to wind up operations. This becomes a much more political hot burden in China. The reason is this, a lot of the money that's owed, is owed to people who have put deposits down on apartments and houses that will now never get built. Really the big issue is that this is a political question as much as it is a financial one. In China, most of the money is owed to individuals who put deposits down for houses that they're not going to get. Bankruptcy law treats them very low in the stack, but internationally, most of the debt is owed outside of the country and so what does China do here? Do they follow bankruptcy law or did they do the politically efficient thing?Dylan Lewis: Bill, Jason, We'll see you a little bit later in the show. Up next we've got a familiar name in your financial lives that might be worth looking at in your portfolio. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.Dylan Lewis: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. When you hear FICO, your mind might go to personal finances and your credit card statements, but you'd be pretty happy if the name was in your stock portfolio. The company is the standard in consumer credit scores and under CEO Will Lansing over the last 12 years, shareholders are up over 3,000% crushing the S&P 500. This week we caught up with Lansing about his team's management philosophy. Why investors should focus on more than just the company's scoring business and the way AI and buy now, pay later are affecting the credit industry. I'm sure our listeners know the name FICO and probably know that you're a number that matters in their financial lives. But could you kick off talking a little bit about how you fit into the consumer credit and scoring place? Because I know there are a lot of players in that environment.Will Lansing: That's probably the place where we're best known is for our scores, FICO scores, that's one of our two businesses. We have scores and software. Scores has been an evolving business for us and we got started in it long ago. We're a 65 year old company and we got into proprietary scores for lenders in the 50, 60 years ago. What happened was we found ourselves building scorecards for individual banks. We did that for many years and we thought, if we could make one of these more generic, more available to everybody, there would be a market for it. In 1987, we launched the first industry wide FICO score in partnership with Equifax. That had a great success, the lenders loved that. Suddenly they had this low cost, automated way to evaluate credit and so that took off. Our next innovation was, well, instead of just doing it on the Equifax credit file, why don't we do this on Trans Union and Experience also and we'll have more of an industry wide score available to any lender who uses any of the three bureaus data. So we did that and it made the score even more popular with lenders because as you can imagine, it gave them a little bit of flexibility and leverage with the bureaus and suddenly it was available to a lot more lenders. That worked out pretty well.Then what happened was the regulators who are looking for ways to evaluate the risk in the portfolios of the banks that they regulate, identified FICO score as a common way of evaluating risk. They started to ask the lenders for that. Let us see the average FICO score for this portfolio, for that portfolio, that went over pretty well. Relatively quickly the regulators came to rely on the FICO scores, pretty scientific and easy to get measure of risk for those portfolios. So now you've got the lenders who are using it because it's a great value proposition for them. They can make low cost credit decisions. You've got the regulators who are finding it useful for measuring risk. Lenders are happy to please the regulators as you can imagine. Then, a lot of, certainly in the last 40 years, a lot of lenders have taken to securitizing their loans. You have the investors saying to the lenders, hey, how can we evaluate the risk In this paper you're trying to sell us. Obviously the FICO score, which is available for every one of the loans in there, becomes a really good tool for investors to evaluate the quality of the portfolios that they're buying. Now you've got these three constituencies that are all relying on the FICO score. That's really how we became the anchor of the credit ecosystem. That's why we're so deeply embedded, where we are the industry standard. We're very predictive, there's a lot of good reasons for it. But also the network for effects are very powerful because once you're as deeply embedded as we are, it's hard to get out.Dylan Lewis: So is the thought there that basically you guys have done something well, and when you do something well, the use for it just continues to grow and grow and you're able to serve more stakeholders?Will Lansing: For sure. I'm often asked, how is it that FICO became an industry standard. Everybody would like to be an industry standard. How did you guys do it? As I explained, it happened over time with building different constituencies for the score. Then you get into network effects because you have all the utility that happens in different places. Actually we worked on that, we became ever more embedded and then we thought, is there anything else we can do to really cement our position in this ecosystem? We're running a business. We came up with this idea about ten years ago. We came up with this idea of providing the FICO score to consumers. We said, hey, you lenders, you're buying the FICO score from us. How about if we give you a free reuse and you can share it with your consumer customers? Initially they were a little hesitant because they didn't want us even more embedded than we already were. But over time they came to recognize the utility of it and a number of big lenders explored it, experimented with it and found it very successful. Consumers really liked it. Now we're in 250 million accounts across the country providing free FICO scores to consumers. You probably get your FICO score from your bank for free. That's typical, but again, it just cements our position. How's the bank going to say goodbye to FICO when there's so much reliance by the consumer and everyone else on the score.Dylan Lewis: Looking at the state of the business now and some of the recent results that you guys put up when you posted earnings, it seems like you're seeing good growth in scores. Seems like you're seeing relatively good growth in software as well. What are the portions of the business that you're excited about and that you feel like people should be paying attention to?Will Lansing: Well, I think you're absolutely right that we have good growth on both sides of the business and that wasn't always the case. I think if you go back 15 years ago, our software business was growing one or 2% a year. Our scores business was growing five, six, 7%. It really went with GDP. It went up and down with GDP. Which is understandable given its role and we've done a lot of things to it. Now both our software business and our scores business grow double digit, almost consistently year in year out. I'm excited about both sides of the business. They're different because the scores business is an IP licensing business. So it's got very, very high margins. It's a 90% margin business, growing double digit. That's part of why our stock is as popular as it is. Then our software business is much more of a business of the future because we're growing very fast. Our software platform business is growing over 40% year over year and has been for four years. I think that tells you that the dog is eating the food. The CRM business is alive and well and it's going to do very well, but it's not a profitable business today. It's a break even business and that's because we're pouring money into R and D, we're chasing market share and maintaining our lead from a features and functionality standpoint. Someday, we'll improve the margins. That's up to us. We have the opportunity to do that whenever we choose to. But right now, we're putting all the energy into growth, growth, growth. Which side am I excited about? I love them both. There are two wonderful children that I love equally.Dylan Lewis: You've mentioned the stock performance there by my count and these are round numbers. I think stock is up about 3,000% since you took over the CEO role in 2012. Top line has gone from about 650 million to over 1.5 billion. Net income is about five x to 450 million on a trailing 12 month basis. Can you talk a little bit about the management philosophy you mentioned focusing on growth right now. But just what you guys are prioritizing when it comes to allocating capital and the projects that you're interested in.Will Lansing: Yeah, absolutely. Well, thank you for pointing out statistics out, and it's really great when you point them out relative to the S&P 500 or the Russell 3,000 because we're in the top 1%. We're in the 99th percentile on total shareholder return against all the major indices. We're top 10 company out of the S&P 500 on TSR over the last 12 years. So that's the track record and the philosophy that goes with it is you start with believing that your job is to make the stock more valuable. Your job is to take care of shareholders. That's what we think we have to do here. That's what we wake up every morning thinking about. Now obviously, the only way you get there is by focusing on customers and quality product and employees and all the constituencies that the company touches. But there's no fuzziness in our thinking. There's a lot of clarity. Our goal is to take care of our shareholders and to maximize the value of FICO over the long term. We take a three to five year horizon. We do nothing on a quarterly basis. So unlike a lot of software businesses, we do not chase quarterly earnings. We give guidance annually and the business goes up and down on a quarterly basis, and we don't really pay a lot of attention to it. Unlike a lot of software businesses, you don't get extra discount for closing a deal at the end of the quarter. Our guys are instructed to tell our customers, well, this is the price and you can have next week, you can have this week when you're ready to buy the stuff we'll work with you. It's a much healthier relationship with your customers. In the long run, it took a while to get this culture in place, but in the long run, I think it's good for the business, it really is good for the business. Shareholders for long term view of the business, we treat it like a family business. We have three values in our company.Speaker 1: Act like an owner, delight our customers, and earn the respect of others. Those are the three. But the Number 1 value in our company is act like an owner. I never miss an opportunity with our people to talk about, this is your company. We have very wide stock ownership also with and we have 3,500 employees, over a third of them on stock. I mean, a lot for a public company. I encourage them to think about it as a family business and you have money and resources at your disposal, you have budgets that you work, you have people who work for you, you have your own time. If you don't feel like you're spending your financial and human capital the right way, you have an obligation to stand up and change it. This is your business. If it were a family business, would you be doing what you're doing or would you change it? That's really the mentality in our place. It's a real ownership mentality. I too I'm a big owner of the business. I'm a public company CEO, but my network is tied up in this company. Everyone knows it. I treat it like a family business. In terms of capital allocation, we don't do a lot of MNA. It's an interesting problem because we have a very high PE and so virtually anything we wanted to do would be a creative. If our only goal were accretion, we would do a lot more MNA than we do. But the problem comes when you start comparing a business that we would buy with the business that we're already in. On that basis, they're all dilutive.We look at it and we say, well, do we like that business better than we like our own? If the answer is no, we don't and that's typical. We say, well, let's take our free cash flow and put it into stock buyback. If you look at that over the last, it's more than just my tenure. But certainly, during my tenure, we have been very big buyers of our own stock. I mean, we were 76 million shares at the high point. We were 36 million shares when I joined the board, and we were 30 million shares when I became CEO, and today we're about 25 million shares. So we've come down quite a bit. We're basically kind of a slow-motion LBO. We like it that way. We're very confident in our own business. We love our business, we're confident in our business, and given the choice, we'd rather put the money into our own business than into another one. We still do very small acquisitions, little tuck ins for technology, sometimes talent acquisitions. But although we look all the time, we're always looking. The reality is we just like our business better than everyone else's. There's a reason we love our business. I mean, it's a good business.Dylan Lewis: There are a couple things that seem to be affecting the industry that I want to dig into with you and get your take on. The first one, and this is true of anybody in the tech space, anybody of the software space, is artificial intelligence. Knowing that you're in analytics and knowing that you're in software, what do some of the AI investments look like for FICO?Speaker 1: We are obviously involved in AI. We have a bunch of patents in AI. It's an interesting area for us because we've been in analysts, we've been in AI for a very long time, and machine learning, and neural nets, and there's a time place for it. On generative AI, which is what everyone's buzzing about these days, I think that FICO will benefit in the same way that everyone else does in terms of lowering costs and call centers, and coding, and things like that. I think that in underwriting, it'll be quite a while before AI really works its way into the production side of underwriting. That's because it's so heavily regulated. The regulators demand to understand, why did you make the decision that you made? Let's make sure that it complies with fair lending practices. AI doesn't lend itself easily to that. It's a little bit more of a black box and you have to unpack how it is that the AI got to the decision that it got to. Now, we have a bunch of patents in this space where we call it explainable AI, ethical AI, and we do have patents in the space and we are prepared to use it. We do use AI and synthetic data in our modeling. You have to be careful and use it in the right places. That's how it affects us. We definitely are investing in it. For others, sometimes it's a hobby and a toy and I think there's also appropriate uses.Dylan Lewis: One of the other things I wanted to ask you about was buy now, pay later. This is an interesting topic in credit. It's been growing very quickly. We actually saw quite a few consumers taking use of buy now, pay later programs this holiday season. Can you talk a little bit about how it fits into the credit industry right now?Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely. Buy now, pay later typically is people who are expanding their access to credit by working a deal with a buy now pay later company to essentially buy a product on installment. That's basically what it is. The challenges are that the bureaus don't all treat the payments the same way. They don't treat this data the same way. There's not a consistency yet in how it's treated. I think that there's a benefit for consumers because not only do they have the access to the incremental credit, but they also can provide more data to those who care about their credit practices. There are opportunities to improve your credit standing with buy now, pay later. FICO is working with a firm right now to sort out how do we standardize the use of the buy now, pay later data so they can really be incorporated in scores and give people access to credit they wouldn't otherwise have on the revolving side. I think it's a good development in the industry. It fits a very specific need. I mean, we've had installment loans forever, but I think we've figured out how to do it in 21st century way. I think it's a good thing and we're working on trying to get the benefit of it for the consumer on the data side. We're working out how to do it well.Dylan Lewis: Listeners, we're always looking for ideas on companies and leaders you want to hear from. If you've got an idea, shoot us a note at podcasts at fool.com. Coming up after the break, Bill Mann and Jason Moser return with a couple stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.As always, people in the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined again by Bill Mann and Jason Moser. We're going to jump right into radar stocks. Each week you bring the stocks, our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, hits you the question, or sometimes even better yet, more of a comment. Bill, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?Bill Mann: I'm looking at one of the most powerful cosmetics brands in the world, a company called Estee Lauder. Their company has been hit very hard, lost a lot of market share. They've lost a lot of gross margin. The question for me, and their earnings are on Monday, are they going to get back to their former glory? They are forecasting $2.60 in earnings. Two years ago, they were seven dollars. If it is a $2.60 stock, it's very expensive. It's more to a seven dollar stock. It is very cheap. It's a company that's a family run company. Basically, they've had a story line that would have fit on succession, [laughs] but here we are, and the company still goes forward. What are we going to get on Monday?Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Estee Lauder.Dan Boyd: Yeah. Bill, respectfully, what the heck do you know about cosmetics?Bill Mann: Dan it depends. Eighty percent gross margins. Do you like money?Dan Boyd: I mean, that makes sense. You can't just ignore it just because you're not necessarily the end customer.Bill Mann: I use product.Dan Boyd: Yeah.Bill Mann: I've got a facial regiment. I don't know what your problem is, Dan.Dan Boyd: All right. Jason, what's on your radar this week?Jason Moser: Keeping an eye on Etsy. Ticker is E-T-S-Y. We will see Etsy earnings toward the end of the month, but before that, we saw this week Elliott Management is going activist on Etsy. They built up a 13 percent stake in the company and even got a board seat. You know, it's funny. You read management's take on this, they seem to be optimistic about this. I don't know. But clearly the company has pulled back significantly after the big COVID bounce that so many companies saw over the last few years. Etsy is a good business. Let's get that out of the way. Fundamentally, it's a good business but they've hit a wall. They pulled a lot of growth forward as most did and I think now you have some questions in regard to the house of brand strategy they did, dump Elo7 in the middle of last year, and that was a relatively smaller acquisition. But it at least begs the question, are these other acquisitions paying off or will they pay off as management had hoped? Given Elliot's track record, this could very well be a positive catalyst for the stock in the coming quarter, so looking forward to the earnings report at the end of the month.Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Etsy.Dan Boyd: How about a comment and said. This is one of those shops where whenever my wife is on Etsy, I start to get a little concerned about the bank accounts, boys.Jason Moser: Right there with you.Dylan Lewis: I was going say, I mean, I think that this is a very Valentine's radar stock segment. We have gift ideas. We have gift ideas abound. Dan, which one's going on your watch list this week?Dan Boyd: Honestly, this is a tough one. But the truth is, I don't know Estee Lauder very well, so I got to go with Etsy.Dylan Lewis: I'm a proud customer and a fan of the pick, Dan. Thank you for weighing in. Bill Mann and Jason Moser, thanks for being here. That's going do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Dylan Lewis. Thanks for listening.

       "  \"In this article, we discuss 12 best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and NASDAQ’s performance, head over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024.\\xa0In December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains.\\xa0The market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.The trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.Despite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.To benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\\xa0Our Methodology\\xa0We chose the top stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\\xa0Photo by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global semiconductor company specializing in the design and development of complex digital and mixed-signal semiconductor devices. It operates in two segments – Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has projected a 2024 outlook with anticipated revenue of $50 billion and EBITDA margins of 60%. The company acknowledged some cyclical challenges in its broadband and storage semiconductor businesses but anticipates strength in the latter part of the year. Despite expected headwinds in the first half of 2024, investment advisory firm Summit Insights Group upgraded Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock to Buy on December 8, expressing confidence that the company will likely outperform its outlook for 2024.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), with 2 million shares worth $1.70 billion. Overall, 87 hedge funds were bullish on the stock.\\xa0In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to monitor.\\xa0ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.Semiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a global company engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and sale of memory and storage products. The company operates through four segments – Compute and Networking Business Unit, Mobile Business Unit, Embedded Business Unit, and Storage Business Unit. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy.\\xa0J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur, with an Overweight rating, raised the price target on the stock to $105 from $90 on December 21. He emphasized the significance of high-bandwidth memory products, anticipating them to be a substantial revenue driver in 2024, driven by increased demand for memory in AI projects.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 90 hedge funds were bullish on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 86 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the leading position holder in the company, with 8.10 million shares worth $551.6 million.Here is what Claret Asset Management has to say about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 102Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks for 2024. On January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.11. Revenue for the period increased 12.5% year-over-year to $8.83 billion, topping market expectations by $120 million. The global streaming paid memberships increased by 13.12 million to 260.28 million. Netflix revealed Q1 2024 guidance, indicating anticipated revenue of $9.24 billion compared to the consensus estimate of $9.26 billion, and projected earnings per share (EPS) of $4.49 as opposed to the consensus estimate of $4.14.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 102 hedge funds were bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), compared to 114 funds in the preceding quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is one of the biggest stakeholders of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth over $970 million.\\xa0Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its CPU microprocessor market share to 18.4% in the fourth quarter, marking a gain of 73 basis points, according to data from Mercury Research cited by investment firm Citi. Citi holds a Buy rating on AMD as of February 7.\\xa0According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was part of 110 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 112 in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.28 billion.White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a global software company operating in three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024. On December 13, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $4.27 and a revenue of $5.05 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.13 and $30 million, respectively.\\xa0According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion.\\xa0Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 134Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 7th on our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a FQ1 GAAP EPS of $2.18 and a revenue of $119.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.07 and $1.34 billion, respectively. Apple also declared a $0.24 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on February 15, to shareholders of record on February 12.\\xa0According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 134 hedge funds were bullish on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 135 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 915.5 million shares worth $156.75 billion.Bireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 163Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in. On January 30, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported its fourth quarter results.

       "  'Stocks have kept investors on a roller-coaster over the last few years, but great businesses with long-term growth potential haven\\'t gone anywhere. Meanwhile, 2024 is already off to a strong start with the S&P 500 hitting multiple new all-time highs, perhaps a sign that investor sentiment is turning more positive after a few years of everyone holding their breath waiting for a recession to hit.No one can precisely predict the ebbs and flows of the stock market, and if global economic conditions continue to prove bumpy, that will inevitably affect companies across a range of sectors. However, the stock market has a wonderful habit of consistently throwing off bearish periods and rising higher than before with the passage of time.So, if you stay invested in great businesses through both the ups and downs of the market, you will experience those rocky days, but you can also benefit from the best days in the market too. And, while cryptocurrency might be a viable investment for some, you don\\'t need to bet on high-risk assets to build enviable returns.On that note, let\\'s take a look at three tech stocks you may want to add to your portfolio as 2024 kicks off.Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is known for boasting the most popular search engine in the world, and to this day, most of its revenue comes from advertising through Google Search. In 2023, Alphabet recorded revenue of $307 billion, up 9% from 2022, and net income of $74 billion, up 23% year over year.Even though the company makes most of its money from advertising -- $66 billion of its entire fourth-quarter revenue of $86 billion came from Google advertising -- subscriptions are increasingly forming a larger part of the financial picture for this business. Subscriptions now account for $15 billion in annual revenue for Alphabet, which is five times more than its subscription revenue pre-pandemic in 2019. These subscriptions come from various properties, primarily YouTube-driven, including YouTube TV, YouTube Premium, YouTube Music, and Google One.Alphabet\\'s AI investments are also paying off, even though the company is just at the cusp of what these technologies could mean for the future growth of its business. The tech giant launched its latest artificial intelligence (AI) model called Gemini late last year. Gemini will have three versions, Gemini Ultra (designed for large-scale, complex projects), Gemini Pro (designed for a range of tasks of varying complexity), and Gemini Nano (designed for tasks you would perform on a mobile device like the Android).CEO Sundar Pichai described this latest AI release in the 2023 earnings call, noting: \"It\\'s engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video, and code in a natively multi-modal way, and it can run on everything from mobile devices to data centers.\"The future looks bright for Alphabet\\'s mainstay businesses, but tech investors many also want to capitalize on its growth trajectory in the AI revolution and beyond.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) made headlines recently for its just-launched Vision Pro, an addition to the tech behemoth\\'s hardware business that runs anywhere from $3,500 to $4,000 per headset. While there may be a variety of use cases for this product in both personal and professional settings, Apple\\'s bread and butter is still its iPhone business.Despite changes in consumer spending over the last few years, consumers still spent $70 billion on iPhones in the first quarter of Apple\\'s fiscal 2024, accounting for roughly 60% of the company\\'s entire net sales for the quarter ($120 billion). This helped the company reach a new all-time high for its installed base of products, which totaled 2.2 billion active devices as of the end of the quarter.Apple\\'s earnings per share (EPS) hit a new all-time high in the quarter as well, totaling $2.18, a 16% year-over-year bump.The other notable win for Apple was its Services segment, which is now the second-largest driver of revenue and hit a new all-time record in the quarter. Services revenue, which includes sources like advertising as well as subscriptions to services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, totaled $23 billion in the first quarter of Apple\\'s fiscal 2024. That figure was up 11% from one year ago.Looking back over the trailing 12 months, Apple has recorded total net income of more than $100 billion. Through thick and thin, this business continues to drive meaningful growth and deliver those returns back to shareholders. If you\\'re on the hunt for a mainstay business to add cash to, Apple looks like a no-brainer buy.Upstart (NASDAQ: UPST) has had a rough series of quarters, as lending volume retracted in a still turbulent economic environment.The stock is down double-digits from the start of 2024, although at the time of this writing, shares are still trading about 50% higher than one year ago. That perhaps surprising performance, given the struggles the business has been having, is partially attributable to a wave of short-selling that hit the stock last year as well as some positive market days.As always, you need to look beyond the share price at the underlying business. Right now, it\\'s a tough time for most businesses with broad exposure to the lending industry, and particularly so for a company like Upstart that makes most of its money from various fees attached to originating and servicing loans.Revenue is down and the company is not profitable right now. However, the company has still retained a competitive advantage that continued to drive lenders to join its platform despite overall declines in loan volume. In fact, Upstart has roughly 900% more lending partners like banks and credit unions using its platform now than it did when it became publicly traded just over three years ago.Upstart\\'s platform doesn\\'t predicate loan approvals or denials on the basis of the FICO score as the traditional lending industry has often done, but around a machine learning and AI-driven model that factors in about 1,500 variables to assess consumer creditworthiness. Because this model is constantly changing and adjusting not only to the individual applicant but to the macro environment at large, loan approvals being down isn\\'t simply a function of the lending landscape; it\\'s the response of Upstart\\'s model to lending risk on the whole.So, fewer applicants are being approved and the applicants who are approved are generally paying higher interest rates for loans. While Upstart has had to carry more loans than usual due to the risk of funding facing many of its partners in this environment, institutional investors and originating lenders are still purchasing the lion\\'s share of loans. The company is also building out its footprint in a wide range of lending areas, including auto lending and recently the mortgage lending market.Now, 88% of all loan approvals on the platform are fully automated, a new record for the business. Upstart\\'s model should recalibrate in more favorable lending conditions. Risk-tolerant investors may want to scoop up a slice of this business, or at least keep a close eye on it for now.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

       "  \"Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) standing as one of the most dominant and culturally influential businesses on the face of the planet didn't happen overnight. The consumer electronics and software company has a successful history that spans many decades.With this FAANG stock up more than 48,000% in just the last 20 years, it has undoubtedly turned some investors into millionaires. In fact, a $2,100 share purchase in February 2004 would be worth just over $1 million today (as of Feb. 5). What an impressive return!But at a current market cap of $2.9 trillion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.2, can Apple help prospective investors become millionaires in the future?The Apple of two decades ago is not the one investors are familiar with today. In fiscal 2003, the business generated the vast majority of its net sales from personal computers and laptops, like the Power Macintosh, PowerBook, and iMac. Apple released the third generation of its popular iPod product in the spring of that year, which was its hit hardware device at the time.But no one could have predicted what happened soon after. Things changed in 2007, when the first iPhone was released. The iPhone was a revolutionary product that combined a phone, camera, and music player all in one easy-to-use device. Since then, it's been a meteoric rise for the company to becoming one of the most valuable in the world. Even today, this single product is the most important part of the business, as the iPhone represented 58% of Apple's revenue in Q1 2024 (ended Dec. 31, 2023). And the company gets about 81% of its sales from all of its hardware devices. There's no more iPod, but there are AirPods and an Apple Watch these days.However, there is another segment that is on the rise. Apple's services and software offerings, like iCloud storage, the Apple Music and Apple TV+ streaming services, and Apple Pay, are all gaining greater adoption, thanks in large part to there being 2.2 billion installed Apple devices all over the world.Services revenue grew 12% in the latest fiscal quarter to $23.1 billion, about 19% of the company total. Since it carries an extremely high gross margin of 73%, as more of Apple's sales come from this segment, it can help to lift profitability. It's hard to envision, but the Apple of two decades from now could look completely different.In my opinion, it's unreasonable to expect Apple to repeat its trailing 20-year return of 48,000% between now and 2044. The company is massive today, and the growth going forward might be limited. Sales actually dropped 2.8% in fiscal 2023, and only increased 2.1% in Q1 2024. You can blame the uncertain macro environment, but expecting Apple to grow like it did when it was much smaller is wishful thinking.The iPhone still dominates the tech landscape, but it's a far more mature product today than even a decade ago. As was the case in 2004, bullish investors might be hoping for a new game-changing product release around the corner. But this is hard to predict.It's valid to wonder whether Apple can beat the Nasdaq Composite Index going forward, let alone turn prospective investors into millionaires. As I noted above, the current valuation is expensive, now a huge premium to its trailing 10-year average. This isn't a bargain stock.As a result, unless you have a large six-figure sum to invest in Apple shares right now, the chances of this being a millionaire-maker aren't great.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

       "  'In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best FAANG stocks to invest in. To skip our detailed analysis of the tech industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In.The technology sector has been on a steady rise for quite a while now, and the most obvious answer to the industry\\'s propulsion to greater and greater heights is the ongoing obsession with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Many within the AI space today are large tech companies, such as the FAANG names. These days, however, a new moniker has been on the rise to identify the best tech companies of the day: the Magnificent Seven.The original cohort of tech names to keep an eye on included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), all coming together to form the FAANG group. Today, these companies are challenged by several others in the market, particularly semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA isn\\'t alone either, and so the original list of FAANG stocks has had to accommodate the rise of new and old mega-tech companies bolstered by the emergence of AI.Regardless of what you call these companies or who joins these new exciting groups, the fact remains that the tech sector has been abuzz with news of innovations, rising investments, and higher profitability. At the end of the day, it\\'s starting to look like tech companies really are starting to rule the world.On February 8, Gene Munster, the managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, joined CNBC\\'s \"Squawk Box\" to discuss recent trends in the tech sector and the rise of FAANG stocks, particularly Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here\\'s what he had to say:\"They have the biggest upside potential relative to where expectations are... these three, I think, are largely unappreciated. I just wanna start with Meta. I think it\\'s the biggest AI opportunity that\\'s misunderstood. Most investors understand that Meta is using AI to improve ad campaigns, ad attribution... but there is a significant underappreciated lever that could take this into a whole different atmosphere. This theory comes from Deepwater\\'s Doug Clinton. He believes that ultimately, they will monetize Llama. Llama is an opensource model. The other foundation models, Claude, and ChatGPT, and Gemini, they\\'re all closed. Llama has 30 million downloads. If they monetize this, they will likely announce a cloud infrastructure... that is a whole new shift, and new benefit to Meta.\"On the rise of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, Munster said the following:\"Apple\\'s gonna come out with their own foundation model likely in June, and they\\'re gonna allow this to do personalized AI. This is really gonna capture 20% of the world\\'s interest, and they can charge $10 a month for this.\"Most investors have been overlooking Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, but Munster thinks the company is on its way to benefitting from a new opportunity.In an additional boost for the tech sector, the Biden Administration has announced a $5 billion investment in chips, a move that is bound to uplift the semiconductor industry. On February 9, Ronnie Chatterji, professor at Duke University and former White House Chips Coordinator, joined CNBC\\'s \"Squawk Box\" to discuss this move. He noted that this move signals a partnership between the public and private sectors to ensure that the US continues to lead \"in the current generation of chips\" alongside the \"next generation.\" The investment is thus being welcomed overwhelmingly and may signal greater things for semiconductor companies in 2024.With the current situation being so overwhelmingly in favor of tech companies, we have compiled a list of the best FAANG stocks to buy now. These include some of the top American tech stocks to buy apart from the original FAANG stocks.A technician at a workstation, preparing and calibrating a sensor for automotive microcontrollers.Our Methodology\\xa0We compiled our list of the best FAANG stocks to invest in by consulting Insider Monkey\\'s hedge fund data for the third quarter and selecting major tech companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 102Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is among the original FAANG names. It is a streaming company that operates a popular online streaming platform by the name of Netflix. The company is based in Los Gatos, California.DZ Bank analyst Markus Leistner upgraded shares of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) from Hold to Buy and placed a $600 price target on the stock on January 25.Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was found in the 13F holdings of 102 hedge funds at the end of the third quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $7.8 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were\\xa0Netflix, Inc.\\xa0(NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”Like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is among the best FAANG stocks to buy now.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 107An Overweight rating was maintained on shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) by Simon Coles at Barclays on January 19. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $110 to $125.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is an information technology company. The company manufactures and sells integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices. It is based in Taiwan.We saw 107 hedge funds long Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in the third quarter, with a total stake value of $9.7 billion.Fisher Asset Management was the most prominent shareholder in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) at the end of the third quarter, holding 31.1 million shares in the company.Here\\'s what Wedgewood Partners said about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110There were 110 hedge funds long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in the third quarter, with a total stake value of $9.2 billion.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is another semiconductor company on our list of the best FAANG stocks to buy. The company is based in Santa Clara, California, and offers graphics processing units, chipsets, and embedded processors, among more.Toshiya Hari, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, maintains a Buy rating on shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as of February 1. The analyst also raised the firm\\'s price target on the stock from $157 to $180.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112At the end of the third quarter, Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), holding 4.6 million shares in the company.Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a computer software company based in San Jose, California, and is one of the most attractive stocks on our list of the best FAANG stocks to buy. It offers products such as the Document Cloud, a unified cloud-based document services platform, and the Creative Cloud, a subscription service providing access to creative products.As of January 2, Piper Sandler\\'s Brent Bracelin holds an Overweight rating on shares of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $650 to $705.Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was seen in the portfolios of 112 hedge funds in the third quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $8.2 billion.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Based in San Francisco, California, salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is an application software company. It offers Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology.At the end of the third quarter, salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) had 122 hedge funds long its stock, with a total stake value of $10.5 billion.An Outperform rating was maintained on salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) on January 23 by Rob Oliver at Baird. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $300 to $310.Polen Capital said the following about salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and\\xa0Salesforce, Inc.\\xa0(NYSE:CRM).Salesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”Like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top FAANG+ stocks to invest in today.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 134Holding 54.9 million shares in the company, Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder in Apple Inc.\\xa0 (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the end of the third quarter.Samik Chatterjee at JP Morgan maintains an Overweight rating on Apple Inc.\\xa0 (NASDAQ:AAPL) alongside a $215 price target as of February 2.Apple Inc.\\xa0 (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a big tech company and one of the best FAANG stocks on our list.

At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”\\xa0Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In.\\xa0Suggested articles:13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 YearsDisclosure: None. 11 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In\\xa0is originally published by Insider Monkey.'],\n",

       "  'Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $188.08 at the end of trading on February 8. In the preceding 52 weeks, the stock price has fluctuated from $143.90 to $199.62.On February 1, Apple reported its first quarter earnings results for the quarter ending December 30, 2023. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showed payments for dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.825 billion, up from $3.768 billion in the same period in 2022.Based on its current quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share, the annualized dividend for Apple is $0.96 per share. Using the stock price at the close on February 8, its dividend yield is about 0.51%.If you have an earnings target of $500 per month or $6,000 annually from Apple\\'s dividends, your investment value needs to be $1,176,471 which is 6,255 shares at $188.08 each. But if you reduce your earnings target to $100 per month, your investment value drops to $235,294 or 1,251 shares.Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Dara Khosrowshahi gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.How to earn $500 Per Month In Passive Income Through Real Estate Without Becoming A LandlordHow to calculate your estimated value of investments using dividend yields: To calculate an estimated investment value, you need two critical variables — the desired annual earnings target ($6,000 or $1,200) and the dividend yield of the stock (0.51% in this case). So, $6,000 / 0.0051 = $1,176,471 to generate an income of $500 per month, and $1,200 / 0.0051 = $235,294 for $100 per month.To calculate the dividend yield, you need to divide the annual dividend payments by the stock’s current price. It is important to note that a company\\'s dividend yield may change over time. This is because of the fluctuations in stock prices and changes in dividend policies on a rolling basis. Assuming that the stock price does not fluctuate or the capital appreciation is not factored into the calculations, the dividend value and its yield are positively correlated.For instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2 / $50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2 / $60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2 / $40).Disclaimer: This calculation is according to the price per share on Feb. 8 using an annualized dividend. The price of Apple stock at the end of trading on Feb. 8 was $188.08.Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\\xa0Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

       "  \"Angela Ahrendts may have played one of the toughest games of hard-to-get ever with Apple CEO Tim Cook. In 2014 when Ahrendts was CEO of London-based luxury retail brand Burberry, Cook tried to convince her several times to head up retail at the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant.Ahrendts was steadfast in convincing Cook that she wasn’t the right fit for the job.“I'm absolutely not a techie,” she told Cook, according to a 2016 interview at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit. “I'm actually not even a great retailer.” But Cook didn’t take the bait, telling her that the company had plenty of tech-focused employees and had “the most productive stores in the world.”What Apple didn’t have, though, was Ahrendts’ attention to community and ability to humanize a company that had become one of the world’s most profitable. It was a 2011 TED Talk that Ahrendts had given that really caught Cook’s attention—one that was focused on the idea of human energy. Her thesis was that the more technologically advanced our society becomes, the more we need to go back to the basic fundamentals of human communication.“Trust just takes all the barriers away,” Ahrendts said. “I think it's the same in a personal relationship or in a small business or a huge business.”This wisdom that Ahrendts has preached since 2011 is what got her noticed by leaders and celebrities alike. It’s what got her from a small town in Indiana to heading up Apple retail as a senior vice president—and now serving as a senior operating adviser to Kim Kardashian’s new private equity fund, SKKY Partners. It’s that soft skills—like earnest communication and building trust—can make non-techies attractive to the biggest players in the industry and encourage leaders to look beyond just a resume.For Ahrendts, it wasn’t the clout of the position or even brand name of the\\xa0 company that made her eventually give into Cook. It was the promise of being able to build something new and community-focused for a brand that she saw as making a major impact on the world.Ahrendts comes from humble beginnings. She was born and raised in New Palestine, Indiana, which is barely over 2,000 residents and was one of six children in her family. She played tennis, swam, and did gymnastics—and had her first job as a server. Ball State University is where she ended up for college before stints at Donna Karan International (DKNY), Liz Claiborne, and Burberry.When Ahrendts became CEO of Burberry in 2006, she was featured on Fortune’s magazine cover holding an iPad—a symbol showing the company’s commitment to equipping sales representatives with the technology they needed when working with consumers. Little did she know, though, that she’d eventually become one of the top executives at the company that created the very device that made Burberry more successful.“We turned the company around because of Apple—because of all that their technology enabled us to do all over the world,” Ahrendts said. At the time, Ahrendts said that she had “the greatest job in the world,” even to Cook when he first started trying to recruit her to join Apple. She also couldn’t imagine leaving London, where she and her family had been living for almost a decade. But that started to change upon a visit back to the states for the holidays.Apple caught wind that Ahrendts would be home for the holidays and offered to fly her out and meet with her again.“I again admired everything he was doing at Apple, so I did [go], and I but my mission was to talk him out of me,” Ahrendts said. At the time, Ahrendts still turned Cook down, but an email exchange later on is what locked her into a future with the company.After receiving an email from Cook following her visit, Ahrendts sent a “gracious” and “humble” email letting him down—but with one caveat. If Apple would ever consider integrating its retail stores with its online business model, then she’d consider it.“At Burberry, we did everything digital first,” she said. “I wanted to make sure that they did something even greater [where the company] played a more important role in the community.” That alone sparked Cook’s interest, and led to Apple’s great retail redesign after she finally took the job in 2014.With a focus on community, Apple introduced more programming at its stores for adults and children alike, educating them on things including photography and tech features they wouldn’t otherwise be able to learn. She heralded change at Apple retail stores, which she refers to as “Town Squares” where the consumer experience is less about selling them a product and more about helping the customer discover all of the potential that they—and their devices—have. She was also behind the brand’s illustrious gold watch launch and can be thanked for shorter lines at the Apple store due to her focus on online retail.After a successful run with Apple, Ahrendts stepped down in 2019 and served on the boards of Airbnb, Ralph Lauren, and WPP. But in October 2023, she took on her new role as a senior operating supervisor at Kardashian’s private equity firm SKKY partners, which was formed with PE industry veteran Jay Sammons. As of October, SKKY (which started in early 2023) had yet to close a deal yet, but “Ahrendts’s expertise may help the firm make that all-important choice of its first deal,” Emma Hinchliffe, author of Fortune’s The Broadsheet newsletter, wrote.In terms of advice for young women pursuing a path to leadership, her biggest advice is to be confident in what you know—and what you don’t know.“It's so easy along the way to become incredibly insecure about everything you don't know,” she said in the 2016 interview. “Be your best self.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com\"],\n",

       "  'The S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed above 5,000 for the first time ever on Friday. And once again, the stocks leading it higher are the biggest members of the benchmark average.Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) have produced a nearly 20% return to start the year, per analysis from Yahoo Finance\\'s Jared Blikre. The returns from these four stocks alone accounted for roughly 69% of the S&P 500\\'s gain this year as of Thursday.But not all of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks are off to a strong start. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) are having a choppier start to the year. For some on Wall Street, this has become a concern as a shrinking number of stocks are leading the major average higher.Fortunately for investors, even if top stocks are peaking, the market\\xa0should probably still go up.A recent analysis from BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski showed that even when the top stocks driving an outsized part of the market action fall off, returns over the next year for the index historically\\xa0have been quite good.A chart from Belski shows that since 1992,\\xa0on average, the S&P 500 has risen 14.3% in the year following a peak in contribution from the top 10 stocks in the benchmark average. The only time the S&P 500 delivered a negative return in the next year was in 2001 amid the fallout from the tech bubble.\"While some investors may be concerned that the market is likely to struggle without these stocks leading the way, our analysis shows that the S&P 500 has performed just fine following peaks in relative performance of the 10 largest stocks,\" Belski wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider pointed out that while the degree to which top\\xa0stocks are dragging the major index higher is currently abnormally high, the idea that a few winners lead the S&P 500 gains isn\\'t a new concept. In fact, Snider argued, in the long run it\\'s been a typical feature, not a bug, of the benchmark index.\"That\\'s part of why the S&P 500 or the US equity market broadly has been so strong over the years. ... New companies grow, and they become larger weights in the index, and they drag the market higher with them,\" the analyst told Yahoo Finance. \"And eventually, there will be disruptors and new technologies that emerge and new businesses that emerge. And those will become larger. And then, it will be their turn to drag the market higher.\"For the S&P to hit new records without significant contributions from the Magnificent Seven, there would need to be a broadening out in the market, where other lagging sectors begin to pick up steam. This has been seen recently in areas such as large-cap Healthcare (XLV), which is up 17% from its October lows, and the Financial Select Sector ETF (XLF), which is up 24% from October lows.With 70% of S&P 500 companies topping analysts\\' earnings per share forecasts in the fourth quarter, above the historical average of 63%, Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon pointed to the increased breadth in earnings growth as a positive catalyst moving forward.\"You\\'re seeing [an] even higher percentage [of] companies posting positive earnings this quarter than last quarter,\" Kwon told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"So actually, earnings breadth is improving as well, and that\\'s a positive cycle for equities.\"Snider thinks this broadening out is the most likely scenario this year once investors feel more confident in the Federal Reserve\\'s interest rate-cutting path.\"As investors stop worrying so much about exactly when the Fed will start to cut rates, I think we\\'ll see a lot of these companies outside of the Magnificent Seven have pretty strong earnings growth, and that will cause them to do pretty well in turn,\" Snider said.Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

       "  'Apple has started shipping its Apple Vision Pro, its take on a headset that combines Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR).While the product is an amazing technical tour de force, I believe the product-market fit of this first iteration is a swing and a miss.I’ve watched other world-class consumer product companies make the same mistakes over and over again:Come up with amazing hardware that creates entirely new capabilities.Forecast demand based on volumes of their previous consumer products.Confuse consumers by defining a new category without a frame of reference.Discover that the hardware doesn’t match the needs of their existing customer base.Work hard and spend a lot of money on trying to push sales on their existing customers.Revenue woefully falls short of forecast. Marketing and capital expenses (new factory, high research and development expense) were predicated on consumer-scale sales. The new product is burning a ton of cash.Ignore or fail to understand adjacent niche industrial markets that would have rushed to buy the product if the company had developed niche-specific demos and outreach.Eventually, pivot to the niche markets that are excited about the product.The niche markets make for great beachhead markets but are too small to match the inflated forecasts and the built-in burn rates of consumer-scale sales.After multiple market pivots and changes in leadership, abandon the product.I lived through the equivalent of this when Kodak (remember them?) launched a product in 1990 called PhotoCD. Kodak wanted consumers to put their film photos on their home CDROM drives and then display them on their televisions. You dropped off your film at a film processor and instead of just getting physical prints of your pictures they would scan the film and burn them onto a Compact Disc. You’d go home with a Compact Disc with your pictures on it.I got a preview of PhotoCD when I was the head of marketing at SuperMac, a supplier of hardware and software for graphics professionals. The moment I saw the product I knew every one of my professional graphics customers (ad agencies, freelancers, photo studios, etc.) would want to use it. In fact, they would have paid a premium for it. I was floored when Kodak told me they were launching PhotoCD as a consumer product.The problem was that in 1990, consumers did not have CDROM drives to display the pictures. At the time, even most personal computers lacked them. Meanwhile, every graphics professional did own a CDROM drive but most didn’t own a high-resolution film scanner. They would have been the perfect launch customers for PhotoCD. To this day, I remember being lectured by a senior Kodak executive, “Steve you don’t get it, we’re experts at selling to consumers. We’ll sell them the CDROM drives as well.”Except the Kodak CDROM drives were the size of professional audio equipment and depending on the model, cost $600 to $1000 in today’s dollars. And when consumer CDROM drives became available they couldn’t play the PhotoCD disks as they were encoded in a proprietary Kodak standard to lock you into their drives!The result? PhotoCD failed miserably as a consumer product. Subsequent pivots to professional graphics users (a segment they knew well) came too late, as low-cost scanners and non-proprietary standards (JPEG) prevailed.Similarly, Apple is trying to push Vision Pro onto their existing consumer customers. All the demos and existing applications are tailored to the consumer market.Additionally, Apple did not create demos for how the Vision Pro could be used in new markets where users would jump at the opportunity to buy a Vision Pro. For example, the internet is rife with proof of demand in an adjacent mass market: helping millions of homeowners repair things around their property.There is also proven demand for Industrial applications outside of the consumer space. Every company that has complex machinery has been experimenting with AR for years. Imagine car repair with a Vision Pro AR tutorial. Or jet engine maintenance. Or the entire gamut of complex machinery. All of these would have been great Vision Pro demos for training and repair. It’s hard to understand why Apple ignored these easy wins.Apple’s entry into new markets by creating new product categories–iPods, iPads, iPhones–is unprecedented in the history of modern corporations. $300 billion (75% of their revenue) is from non-computer hardware. In addition, they’ve created an entirely new $85+ billion subscription business model with the App Store, iTunes, Apple Care, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, and Apple TV.It’s hard to remember, but the first versions of these products launched with serious limitations that follow-on versions remedied. The first version of the iPhone only ran Apple software, it had no app store. It was a closed system. It had no copy-and-paste function, and couldn’t record video, among other limitations. The original Apple Watch was positioned as a fashion accessory. It wasn’t until later that Apple realized the Watch\\'s killer apps were fitness and health. Fixing the technical flaws while finding the right markets took time and commitment.The same will likely be true for the Vision Pro. Apple’s model is to provide the hardware and then let their developer community come up with the kind of applications. However, all of the applications on this first release are in their current markets (entertainment, music, etc.). None of these are killer apps for the product.Apple marketers will realize that adjacent spaces they are less familiar with will provide the first \"got to have it\" beachhead markets. Newer iterations will ride the technology wave of lighter and cheaper versions.Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has made a personal bet on the Vision Pro. More than any other company, they have sufficient resources (cash on hand and engineering talent) to pivot–and ensure the Vision Pro’s product-market fit in the real markets that need it. Here’s to hoping they find it.Steve Blank is an adjunct professor at Stanford and co-founder of the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation.

       "  'Tech stocks have been some of the most lucrative investments in the stock market in recent decades. We\\'ve seen valuations skyrocket, industries disrupted, and many happy (and well-paid) investors along the way.Despite how fast recent developments seem, most of these successes were decades in the making, not overnight wonder stories. That\\'s why the importance of patience in investing can\\'t be overstated.For investors looking for tech stocks that they can hold onto for the next decade, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) (aka TSMC) are options you don\\'t have to second-guess.Apple held the title of the world\\'s most valuable public company for a while until Microsoft recently passed it. Unlike many other big tech stocks that saw their stock prices surge through last year, Apple\\'s stock price growth has lagged. Even still, Apple\\'s \"lagging\" is it being up 22% in the past 12 months.Investors have been concerned about Apple\\'s decelerating revenue growth (particularly with the iPhone), but that\\'s a cyclical issue that\\'s been given too much weight. Smartphone sales across the board have been down, but the segment is poised to reverse course soon.It\\'s a down period for Apple, but when I think of companies I feel comfortable buying and holding onto for the next decade, Apple\\'s at the top of the list. It\\'s innovative, run by a world-class CEO, and with seemingly countless billions of dollars of cash readily available, it has the bank account to sustain practically any economic conditions that come its way.The recently released Vision Pro was Apple\\'s first truly new consumer hardware product since the Apple Watch in 2015. And while that\\'s a reddish flag to some who question Apple\\'s ability to keep innovating at past levels, it makes sense for a company that\\'s prioritizing expanding its services footprint.Apple\\'s service ecosystem earns more consistent and higher-margin income. This helps offset some of the cyclicality of Apple\\'s hardware revenues.A decade from now, it\\'s hard to imagine Apple won\\'t have a more prominent position in the financial and healthcare industries. From ApplePay to the Apple Card to the Apple Watch to Apple Fitness, Apple has been slowly but very surely sticking its foot in the door. Those could be huge growth areas for Apple, and investors will likely be happy they were along for the ride.TSMC is one of the most important companies in the tech ecosystem, and has been for quite some time. TSMC manufactures semiconductors on behalf of a host of other chip companies, providing the computing power to some of the most prominent technologies in the world.TSMC\\'s business can be cyclical. When electronics like smartphones, computers, and game consoles are selling well, chips are in high demand. When consumers cut back on spending, companies aren\\'t as inclined to place large orders for chips. Smartphone chips account for a big part of TSMC\\'s revenue (43%), so the recent slowdown in the industry has affected the company\\'s revenue. Its fourth-quarter revenue was down 1.5% year over year, but that doesn\\'t change the company\\'s long-term outlook.TSMC is one of many major names in the semiconductor industry. Its main competitors include Intel, Qualcomm, and Broadcom. However, it\\'s clear their chips don\\'t compete quality-wise compared to TSMC\\'s chips when you look at how many top companies use TSMC as their go-to source. TSMC provides top quality and scale, which are essential to TSMC customers like Apple, Nvidia, and Tesla, which need high performance and reliability.TSMC has many patents that give it a competitive advantage to help it maintain its spot as the industry leader. With the emergence of AI, TSMC should be able to further use it to its advantage, as many businesses seek its chips to power data centers and other technology essential to AI training and development. TSMC\\'s role in the tech ecosystem is in a position to grow over the next decade.

       "  \"After all of the big tech companies reported earnings, it's obvious that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the odd man out in the group. While there are multiple reasons for this, one clear one is that Apple hasn't embraced or launched new products catering to the artificial intelligence (AI) trend.Instead, Apple's business remained fairly stagnant, relying on consumers to purchase its products. Is this strategy good enough in an AI-powered world? Or do shareholders have something to worry about?In terms of revenue growth, Apple has lagged behind its big tech peers for some time.With revenue increasing just 2% in the quarter, it's barely growing. However, this is an improvement, as Apple reported negative revenue growth in the previous four quarters. In the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year (ended Dec. 30), iPhone sales (which make up nearly 60% of Apple's total revenue) rose 5.9%. While this is an improvement over previous quarters, growing revenue at nearly a 6% pace for a flagship product isn't conducive to having a stock that can beat the market.However, the rise of its services division might be able to help Apple out. Its services segment includes Apple's advertising, cloud services, digital content (like AppleTV+ and Apple Music), and App Store revenue. Compared to its hardware divisions, this part of the business did much better in Q1.MetricServicesHardwareRevenue Growth11%0.05%Gross Margin73%39%Data source: Apple.With nearly double the gross margin of its hardware business, Apple's service division is vital to the Apple investment thesis.With a higher-margin business growing faster than the rest of the businesses, Apple's profits should increase faster than revenue. Combined with its operating expenses hardly increasing (up 1.1%), Apple's earnings per share rose from $1.89 to $2.19 -- a 16% increase.That's strong growth, but it still pales in comparison to how some other companies did in Q4 (although Amazon heavily skews this chart).While these other companies are just starting to see the effects of their AI products on their balance sheet, it's a vital part of the investing thesis moving forward. Apple doesn't have that, and it's relying on three things to push it forward:Continual upgrades to existing products.Growth of its services division.A successful launch of its Apple Vision Pro headset.While that's not a terrible strategy, we've already seen the first part of its stumble as the consumer gets crunched for cash. The second point has worked out phenomenally, but it isn't enough to outweigh the struggles of the continual upgrades. The third point is unknown, but the $3,500 starting price presents a significant entry barrier that may be difficult to overcome.If Apple could add a fourth segment that includes AI integration into its products, it may be enough to propel Apple back into a conversation as one of the top tech companies. But right now, it's getting left in the dust.However, for investors to think Apple is asleep at the wheel is probably unwise. Apple is known for not getting involved in trendy issues and only launches well-thought-out and fully developed products. So, Apple may be working on how it wants to integrate AI right now, but investors are in the dark.Until then, Apple is a highly overpriced stock (29 times earnings) for the growth it's putting up.With other companies growing faster, having a better AI strategy, and a cheaper stock price, I'd rather purchase those than Apple. However, all of this could change with the right product announcements or a turnaround of its core business.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

       "  \"Berkshire Hathaway\\xa0has delivered incredible returns for investors through the years, thanks to the stalwart leadership of Warren Buffett. The massive conglomerate has its fingers in a lot of pies, from tech to insurance to healthcare.Over the trailing decade alone, Berkshire has delivered investors a stunning return to the tune of 250%. For context, the S&P 500's trailing-10-year return sits around 240% at the time of this writing. Pull that window back another 10 years, and Berkshire has delivered a total 20-year trailing return of around 560%, while the wider market has delivered a return of about 545% in that time frame.While individual investors won't have the capital at their disposal that the Oracle of Omaha does, that's all right. You can still become part owner of some of the companies Berkshire invests in, assuming those stocks align with your interests, investing style, and overall financial goals.On that note, here are two companies in Berkshire's broad basket of holdings you might consider adding to your own basket of stocks in the near future.DaVita (NYSE: DVA) represents just a 1% slice of Berkshire's overall portfolio as one of a relatively small list of healthcare stocks owned by the multinational conglomerate. If you're not familiar with this health care stock, the company operates a network of thousands of outpatient dialysis centers across the country, as well as a smaller presence in several international markets.Patients who receive dialysis usually require treatment several times a week. According to the National Kidney Foundation, kidney disease impacts roughly 40 million individuals across the country. As of 2018, around 786,000 individuals experienced kidney failure and required dialysis or a transplant, with the vast majority receiving dialysis. The dialysis market in the U.S. is valued at around $100 billion, with DaVita serving as one of the largest players in the space.In the third quarter of 2023 alone, DaVita facilitated approximately 7.3 million total dialysis treatments. That's an average of 93,000 treatments every day. Revenue for the three-month period totaled $3 billion while operating income reached $496 million for the quarter.Profits, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), totaled $247 million for the quarter and $541 million for the first nine months of 2023. DaVita also raked in a free cash flow of $453 million and an operating cash flow of $661 million in the third quarter of 2023.The Oracle of Omaha has always stressed the importance of buying businesses, not stocks. While DaVita's stock performance hasn't been much to write home about the last couple of years, the stock has delivered a total return of around 96% over the last five years. This business has delivered a return on equity (ROE) of 53% over the trailing-five-year period, a sign that the company is increasing its value and managing investor capital well.If you're looking for a stalwart health care company that can lend stable returns through the years rather than a lightning growth stock, this might be one to add to your list of potential buys.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Berkshire's single-largest position, representing about 46% of its overall portfolio. The tech giant has notably eclipsed the performance of the broader market through the years. Looking at the trailing-five-year period, Apple has delivered a total return of 352% in that time frame compared to the S&P 500's 98% return.Apple remains an indomitable leader in the global smartphone market. In the U.S., which is still the largest market for Apple, the company maintains a whopping 61% market share. Estimates show that Apple shipped 232 million smartphones globally in 2023.Moreover, Apple's smartphone shipments in the final quarter of the year totaled approximately 25% of all global smartphone shipments, more than any other player in this space. That's on par with Apple's global market share of smartphone shipments in the fourth quarter of 2022 but slightly up from its position of approximately 21% in the first quarter of 2023.iPhone sales totaled $70 billion in the first quarter of Apple's fiscal 2024, up 6% year over year. The second-largest driver of financial growth was Apple's services segment, which brought in record net sales of $23 billion, up 11% year over year. Total net sales for the three-month period came to $120 billion, a 2% bump from the prior-year quarter. Apple's trailing-12-month profits stand at $101 billion while operating cash flow for that same period is $116 billion.Another tenet of Apple's business that has been core to Buffett's investment strategy through the years is a company with a faithful habit of paying and raising its dividend. While yielding just around 0.5%, Apple has boosted its dividend by 120% over the last decade alone.The company's history of innovation through all market environments while maintaining wide moats in key target segments is nearly unmatched and makes it a wise addition to any long-term investor's portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in DaVita right now?Before you buy stock in DaVita, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and DaVita wasn’t one of them.

       "  \"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsA rising tide might lift all boats, but the resurgence in the ad market is flowing mostly to the giants.The companies that measure their market cap in the trillions are the ones reaping the rewards of the advertising rebound of 2024, leaving much of the legacy media and even tech's smaller players out of the comeback story.This year Google and Meta, the top two in the digital ads market, are expected to haul in more than $140 billion, according to forecasts by Insider Intelligence. The duo is on track to once again claim nearly half of all digital ads revenue. Even as brands spend their way out of a multiyear ad slump, it's mega enterprises who will be feasting while mostly everyone else claws for scraps.Investors pummeled Snap this week for posting merely 5% revenue growth, the latest example of Wall Street punishing anything that doesn't look like Zuckerbergian conquest. Meta set the bar for expansion. The social media king catapulted its advertising revenue 24% higher, more than doubling the pace of rival Google's 11%. Wall Street dinged Google for that too.Where ad dollars flow underscores the selectiveness of the recovery. Amazon last week reported its ads business swelled 27% year over year. While the company sits in third place in the digital ads market, Amazon is poised to gobble even greater share. It's in the early stages of converting an untapped Prime Video streaming service into an ad platform with a massive, built-in audience. Watch it on Amazon then buy it on Amazon.Overall, worldwide digital ad spending is projected to increase 13.2% this year, the data shows, compared to traditional media ad growth of 2.4%.The other major players expected to amplify their ads business are following a similar playbook of platform economics, capturing the eyeballs of enormous online ecosystems: Walmart and TikTok.As if it couldn't get any harder to run with Big Tech, the same companies that upended the ads business through search and social media are deploying their huge cash piles to invest in new AI tools. They stand to rejigger markets and the attention economy further in their favor.Even Disney (DIS), fresh off a significant earnings beat, a dividend boost, and a burst of flashy announcements, still struggles with the baggage of a legacy media business. Its linear networks segment fell 12% compared to the same period last year, the company reported Wednesday, while the unit's operating income fell 7%.Fox's (FOX) ad revenue, which makes up nearly half of the company's total sales, tumbled 20% in the December quarter versus the year prior, it disclosed earlier this week.And while other media names are scheduled to report later this month, including Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Paramount (PARA), it's likely their ad-reliant finances, without Bob Iger's streaming head start and dealmaking pizzazz, will reveal more of the same.Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

       "  \"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the most successful companies in American history. Since the company came public in 1980, its stock has delivered a whopping 187,580% return. An investment of just $1,000 back at its IPO would be worth more than $1.8 million today.Along with its investors, consumers have also reaped the benefits of Apple's success. The company's iPhone, for example, helped boost their productivity, connect them with their friends and families, and place an endless stream of information at their fingertips.With the start of 2024, though, some Wall Street analysts have soured on Apple stock. According to Benzinga, the stock received three downgrades from analyst firms so far (compared to just one upgrade). On top of that, one major investment bank lowered its price target.Should you heed this new pessimism, or continue to buy Apple stock?Most people who have owned a Mac will tell you it's one of the highest-quality personal computers on the market. However, Apple's iPhone smartphone is responsible for most of the company's value creation since it launched in 2007. There are 2.2 billion active iPhones around the world today, and the device also led to the development of multibillion-dollar product lines like the Watch and AirPods.The latest iPhone 15 Pro lineup also features the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which is a 3-nanometer processor considered to be the fastest in the smartphone industry. It paves the way for improvements to Apple's existing artificial intelligence (AI) software like the Siri voice assistant and autocorrect keyboard function.Most power-hungry AI workloads -- like OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot -- rely on external data centers to process requests, because existing computers and devices simply don't have enough juice to deliver results quickly. But that's all changing, and the A17 Pro is a step in the right direction. See, Apple is reportedly working on its own large language models (LLMs) in-house, which could become the foundation for a chatbot designed specifically for its devices.Imagine a ChatGPT-style tool embedded in every iPhone by default. It could curate text messages, create image and video content, manage your email inbox, and even organize your calendar. Plus, a native chatbot would be incredibly secure because it wouldn't have to send private information away to a data center to process requests. Security has always been a major focus for Apple.Slowing iPhone sales growth has long been a concern for many analysts on Wall Street because the smartphone market is saturated. Apple now mostly relies on existing customers upgrading, and the high-quality nature of the iPhone means those upgrades are happening at a much slower pace.New, faster AI-enabled chips could accelerate the upgrade cycle in the future, especially as consumers become more accustomed to using AI in their everyday lives. Given the enormous installed base of the iPhone globally, any AI software released by Apple could quickly become the most widely adopted in the world.Apple just reported its financial results for the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30). Its total revenue rose 2.1% year over year, led by strong iPhone sales, which jumped 6%. The release of the iPhone 15 Pro in September was a key reason for the strong performance because it was the most significant upgrade in years thanks to its lightweight titanium frame and the A17 chip.Apple's services revenue increased 11.3%, outpacing all other segments. It includes sales from subscription-based services like Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple TV+, as well as revenue from features like Apple Pay. Fast growth in the services segment is critical to the tech titan's bottom line because it's more profitable than the company's hardware business (software can be developed once and sold an unlimited number of times with limited additional cost).A revenue uptick of 2.1% is modest, to say the least. But it reversed a streak of declining year-over-year revenue that spanned the previous four consecutive quarters.Going forward, investors will also monitor sales of the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, which is Apple's first foray into a new hardware platform since it launched the Watch in 2015. The company reportedly sold 200,000 units of the Vision Pro in the first 10 days, a remarkable result considering the $3,499 starting price. Wall Street firm Wedbush thinks Apple could sell 600,000 headsets in 2024, and 1 million in 2025.The Vision Pro isn't necessarily moving the needle yet, because 600,000 units would translate into $2.1 billion in revenue, which represents just 0.5% of the $389.9 billion in total revenue analysts expect the company to generate in fiscal 2024.According to Benzinga, three Wall Street firms downgraded their ratings on Apple stock in January:Barclays downgraded Apple to underweight (from equal weight), reducing its price target to $160 from $161.Piper Sandler downgraded the stock to neutral (from overweight), lowering its price target to $205 from $220.Redburn Atlantic downgraded Apple to neutral (from buy), issuing a price target of $200.Barclays went a step further in February and reduced its price target again, to $158. Then, investment bank J.P. Morgan lowered its price target from $225 to $215, although it maintained its overweight rating.By comparison, there has been just one upgrade of Apple stock this year. Bank of America lifted its rating to buy (from neutral) and raised its price target to $225 from $208.Valuation is one area of concern for investors. Based on Apple's $6.42 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.2. That's a slight discount to the 30.8 P/E of the Nasdaq-100, but Apple's sales growth is muted relative to some of the tech giants that make up that index.Theoretically, that means the discount to the Nasdaq-100 is probably warranted. But waiting for Apple stock to get cheaper has been a fool's game, historically speaking. For example, Apple shares have traded at a P/E ratio as high as 35 and as low as 10 over the past decade, and its stock price has rocketed higher all the same.Generally speaking, investors who sat on their hands waiting for a bargain in Apple stock since its IPO likely missed out on substantial gains in the process:With that said, the company's lackluster growth is a concern. How Apple transitions the iPhone to a fully AI-enabled device might be the key to unlocking its next phase of growth. The Vision Pro platform might also help boost its results once the technology becomes cheaper. Plus, while I wouldn't hang my hat on this in the near term, Apple is reportedly developing a car, which could become a significant source of revenue one day.With all of that in mind, Wall Street's pessimism might be warranted in the very short term, but Apple does have enough potential growth drivers on the horizon to make its stock a long-term buy. Investors with a time horizon of five years or more will likely do well from here.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

       "  'For almost 60 years, the Oracle of Omaha has been dazzling Wall Street. I\\'m talking about Berkshire Hathaway\\'s (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett. Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, he has overseen a greater than 4,760,000% gain in his company\\'s Class A shares (BRK.A). A seven-digit return is certainly going to get a money manager noticed -- and for good reason.What makes Warren Buffett such a hero for everyday investors is his willingness to share his insights on the U.S. economy and investing. Lengthy books have been written that discuss some of his favorite investing philosophies, such as buying stakes in brand-name businesses with sustainable moats and holding these positions for lengthy periods.However, the factor that isn\\'t given nearly enough credit for Berkshire Hathaway\\'s long-term success is portfolio concentration. Warren Buffett and his top investing aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, strongly believe in putting the lion\\'s share of Berkshire\\'s capital to work in their top ideas. And if these top ideas generate sizable returns, Berkshire Hathaway\\'s stock is likely headed even higher.Despite Berkshire having stakes in 49 stocks, as of Sept. 30, 2023, 64% of the invested assets ($236.1 billion) Warren Buffett oversees in Berkshire Hathaway\\'s $371 billion portfolio are being put to work in just three brand-name companies.Any question of whether or not the Oracle of Omaha and his team favor portfolio concentration is made crystal clear by tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which accounts for nearly 46% of Berkshire\\'s invested assets. This Apple stake amounts to 20% of Berkshire Hathaway\\'s market cap, which means the health of Apple and its stock very much matters to Berkshire Hathaway\\'s investors.The three factors that are likely most responsible for luring Warren Buffett, Todd Combs, and Ted Weschler into such an outsized position in Apple are its brand, its ongoing innovation, and its market-leading capital-return program.In most annual brand rankings, Apple comes out on top. It has an exceptionally loyal customer base that allows the company to generate highly predictable operating cash flow. Predictability is rare in the tech sector, which is one of the reasons Apple has so consistently outperformed.Berkshire\\'s investment team is likely also enamored with Apple\\'s innovation. It\\'s been the undisputed leader in U.S. smartphone market share for years and was on the cutting edge of innovation when it introduced the iPad in 2010.Beyond the company\\'s physical product innovation, investors are witnessing CEO Tim Cook transform Apple into a services-focused business. A subscription-driven platform will not only enhance customer loyalty and Apple\\'s operating margin over time, but it\\'ll also help smooth out the sales fluctuations that tend to occur during major iPhone upgrade/replacement cycles.But for Warren Buffett, Apple\\'s capital-return program might be the top selling point. On top of returning around $15 billion annually to shareholders via dividends, Apple has repurchased more than $600 billion worth of its common stock since initiating a buyback program in 2013. Buffett loves buybacks because they increase Berkshire\\'s ownership stake without him or his team lifting a finger.Although it sits a long way behind Apple, money-center giant Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) is Berkshire Hathaway\\'s second-largest holding at $34.6 billion in market value.Out of the 11 sectors of the stock market, there\\'s none Warren Buffett is more knowledgeable about than financials. Within financials, bank stocks are the real area of focus.Interestingly enough, the reason the Oracle of Omaha and his aides have bet big on companies like BofA is because they\\'re cyclical. This is to say that Bank of America is going to succeed and struggle in lockstep with the U.S. economy.Even though recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, they don\\'t last very long. Instead of trying to foolishly guess when these downturns will occur, Buffett and his investing squad have angled Berkshire\\'s $371 billion portfolio to take advantage of long-winded expansions. In Bank of America\\'s case, it\\'s able to steadily grow its loan and lease portfolio over time.What really separates Bank of America from countless other publicly traded banks is that it\\'s the most interest-rate sensitive among U.S. money-center banks. Since March 2022, the most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in four decades has added billions of dollars in quarterly net interest income to BofA\\'s bottom line.Furthermore, Bank of America is enjoying the tangible reward of investing in technology. The company\\'s digitization efforts have increased the percentage of households banking online or via mobile app to 75%, as of Dec. 31, 2023. Digital transactions are considerably cheaper than in-person interactions for banks, which should be a positive for BofA\\'s long-term operating efficiency.Let\\'s not forget that the Oracle of Omaha also loves a good value. Bank of America stock is trading for less than 10X forward-year earnings and can be purchased for right around its book value.The third stock that, along with Apple and Bank of America, collectively makes up 64% of the $371 billion investment portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway is credit-services provider American Express (NYSE: AXP). \"AmEx,\" as the company is more commonly known, has been a continuous holding by Berkshire since 1991.To reiterate, Warren Buffett loves financial stocks and cyclical businesses. Even though there have been 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II, only three of these downturns managed to hit the 12-month mark, and none surpassed 18 months. Disproportionately long periods of expansion have allowed credit-services companies like American Express to thrive.The primary reason AmEx has been such a great investment for so long is its ability to benefit from both sides of a transaction. On one hand, it\\'s the No. 3 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (i.e., the largest market for consumption in the world). This means it\\'s generating a healthy amount in fees from merchants by facilitating transactions.However, American Express is also a lender. Its cardholders are paying interest on their carried credit card balances, along with (possible) annual fees to be a cardholder. During long periods of economic growth, double-dipping can be quite fruitful for the company\\'s bottom line.Another reason AmEx outperforms is the clientele it tends to attract. American Express has always had a knack for luring high-earning cardholders.Although high earners aren\\'t perfect, they\\'re far less likely than the average consumer to alter their buying habits or fail to pay their bills during a modest economic contraction. In other words, the well-to-do are helping AmEx successfully navigate potentially challenging economic climates.I\\'d be remiss if I didn\\'t also mention that American Express has quietly turned into a mammoth dividend stock for Berkshire Hathaway. AmEx recently announced plans to increase its base annual payout to the equivalent of $2.80 per share. Though this represents a mere 1.36% nominal yield, based on where shares closed on Feb. 2, a $2.80 annual dividend is a 33% yield to Berkshire\\'s cost basis of roughly $8.49 per AmEx share.Berkshire Hathaway is on pace to generate around $6 billion in dividend income this year, with AmEx certainly doing its part.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

       "  'Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been really struggling to break through to a new all-time high. Undoubtedly, Apple seems to have been outshined by its peers in the Magnificent Seven, but there exist catalysts that could help power a much-awaited rally, perhaps to the Street-high price target of $250 per share.Indeed, Apple stock seems to be quite the battleground between the bulls and the bears, especially lately. The bears would point to weak growth and stagnation in iPhone demand in the Chinese market. Meanwhile, the bulls have a strong argument that the high-margin Services segment continues to swell and that looming products could easily drive growth rates much higher.Personally, I’m siding with the bull camp. Though bearish arguments are quite sound, I do believe they’re too backward-looking. Sure, the iPhone 15 Pro Max could have had much better sales had the Chinese economy not been in a massive slump. And the recent drama revolving around Apple Watches being pulled from shelves has taken a subtle jab to the wearables segment.Though the recent quarter wasn’t bad, it certainly left much to be desired. Nonetheless, with the Vision Pro selling quite reasonably well, look for the new spatial computing device to become a bigger part of the Apple revenue pie each and every year.Though the Vision Pro probably won’t surpass iPhone sales in the next three to five years, I think it could give the Mac segment a good run for its money. This is especially true if Apple’s innovators can reduce the size and power requirements of the device (a smaller form factor with no detached battery would certainly help the device become more than just a “niche product”).Though it’ll take time for sales in Vision Pro to march higher, I believe that advancements on the software side could act as a driver on the share price in the near-to-medium term. We’re likely more than a year away from the next iteration of Apple’s spatial computer. However, 2024 could see some significant software improvements (especially when it comes to AI) until then.Whether we’re talking about more sophisticated updates to visionOS (the Vision Pro’s operating system) or a growing number of apps (perhaps some of them will be so-called “killer” apps?), the enthusiasm surrounding the product has the potential to grow at an exponential rate from here.In the meantime, I think the Vision Pro’s App Store (there were 600 apps on day one of the release) library is looking quite robust. As more developers get their hands on the visionOS tools, I’d look for the number of apps and games to surge into year’s end. That alone could make the Vision Pro a massive driver of the stock as investors anticipate greater sales in the future in response to the rapidly advancing software ecosystem.Following the release of Apple’s latest results, CEO Tim Cook teased analysts, hinting that generative AI products will be coming later in the year. It’s no mystery that Apple has been investing “tremendous time and effort” (as per Tim Cook) into AI integration. And though it would have been nice to have some more specifics from Cook, like a specific date and features, I believe the AI premium that many Magnificent Seven stocks now command will be commanded by Apple once its new AI innovations are finally unveiled.Mark Gurman of Bloomberg thinks iOS 18 (the next update to iPhone’s operating system that could be a highlight of this year’s WWDC) could represent the “biggest” update in its history, thanks in part to AI. We can only speculate at this point, but I think he’s right on the money. More details on the update may very well help drive the stock above $200, perhaps toward the $250 Street-high target currently held by Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.Ives sees the Vision Pro as Apple’s “first major push” into the realm of AI. If he’s right, other analysts on Wall Street may find themselves racing to upgrade their targets to prices more in line (or maybe exceeding) that of Ives’.Undoubtedly, ChatGPT-like Siri Updates and a potential AI App Store could propel Apple stock from an AI underdog to one of the top contenders, perhaps even a leader. This is especially likely given that a vast majority of Apple’s “golden” installed base will actively use such technologies if they are featured as part of iOS 18.On TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 26 analyst ratings, there are 17 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average AAPL stock price target\\xa0is $208.07, implying upside potential of 10.5%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $158.00 per share to a high of $250.00 per share.It’s easy to be less-than-upbeat on Apple stock as the iPhone maker’s sales growth and shares stall. That said, if you look to Apple’s near future, it’s clear that selling AAPL stock right here could prove to be a mistake, especially if Ives’ predictions come true.For now, I’d look to WWDC 2024 and Vision Pro news as potential catalysts to help drive shares higher on the year. Could 2024 be Apple’s year of AI? I think it could be.Disclosure'],\n",

       "  \"Since Apple launched the Vision Pro last Friday, I’ve been hammering home the importance of immersive content. This isn’t a radical suggestion by any means. At this point we’re all keenly aware that hardware platforms live and die by content offerings.Remember all the way back, for a moment, to the end of 2014. When Tim Cook unveiled the first Apple Watch alongside the iPhone 6, the product was met with some blank stares. What, many wondered, was the point of such a device? It wasn’t the Dick Tracy wristwatch we’d been promised since the mid-1940s, but rather a small-screen extension of the iPhone.It took Apple a few years to really hone in on fitness as the device’s single biggest driver. When you wear a smartwatch these days, you get a lot fewer questions about why you would possibly want to own such a gadget. There’s no guarantee that the Vision Pro will follow a similar trajectory, but if does, it will be on the backs (faces) of app and game developers.The Vision Pro is an unquestionably impressive piece of hardware. It does several key things — including passthrough, spatial association and high-res displays better than anyone else in the consumer space. But plenty of people are understandably still asking, “Why?” As in, why would someone spend $3,500 on that? The price and extended reality’s long, spotty history have cast additional doubt on Apple’s first headset.Ultimately, however, the “why” can be traced back to content. A little less than a week after the device’s launch, what should we point to as the Vision Pro’s killer app? For the moment, it’s computing. This is where Apple has leaned heavily, partially in a bid to appeal to enterprise customers with deep pockets. If these organizations purchase headsets in bulk, scaling will help bring down the cost of subsequent models.The beauty of the platform play is that it’s a method to crowdsource functionality. Apple may have more money than any deity you can name, but its developer resources are still finite. By leaning on 3D parties, you tap into a wealth of outsider perspectives that bring the sort of outside-the-box thinking that is often considered counterproductive to the bottom line inside the gears of a large corporation.In the lead-up to the Vision Pro's release, whether Apple still possessed the standing to attract key developers remained something of an open question. Six hundred “optimized” apps at launch was a strong showing for a first-gen device in a category with a rocky track record. That figure is bolstered by significantly more iPadOS apps that can run on the device. As for what constitutes “optimization,” the answer isn’t as straightforward as you might think.This can be as simple as tweaks to the UX in line with the shift from touch to hand gestures or as complex as full immersion and advanced hand tracking. For the sake of this piece, I am most interested in optimized apps with immersive properties. Using an iPad app on the headset generally isn’t a bad experience (nor do you want full immersion all the time), but we’re here to talk about a bleeding edge $3,500 piece of hardware — let’s see what this bad boy can do.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvK6Q2FdyCg?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent&w=640&h=360]I’m a staunch believer in screen breaks. Take a walk, read a book, speak with a human, touch the proverbial grass. If anything, this is more important when that screen is strapped to your head. After spending a little over a week with Vision Pro in my home, I’ve found that my usage tends to be divided in clusters. For instance, I’m writing this to you on my desktop — the real one, not the virtual. My interaction with the infinite desktop experience is still limited.I find the device is best used with intentionality. Rather than simply attempting to convert as much of my life to spatial computing, using the Vision Pro is an ongoing process of determining when it is the best tool for the job at hand (I will wholly admit that my philosophy might be different if I had paid the upfront costs, rather than reviewing a loaner unit). Your mileage will vary, but I tend to get motion sickness relatively easily, so I’ve been limited to sessions around 30 minutes.A few apps have crept into my morning routine during this time. I’ve been suffering from degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis and sciatica for several months now. Things like that put a real damper on your ability to head to the gym. As I’ve been engaging in a little self-rehab, however, I’m more able to do moderate exercise. My mornings now involve 20 minutes of Apple Fitness+ Pilates, followed by a game of Synth Riders on the Vision Pro.The latter has been ported over from the Meta Quest. It’s a Rock Band/Guitar Hero rhythm game, wherein your hands become instruments that collide with orbs barreling toward you at great speeds. It’s a fun, quick game that’s reminiscent of Beat Saber. Here, all the levels revolve around synth tracks and the broader aesthetic can be described as “’80s Trapper Keeper.” It features either full or partial immersion, depending on how aware you need to be of your surroundings.Synth Riders is about the most exercise you can get away with on the Vision Pro, given price, weight and battery pack. I don’t break a sweat playing the game; it’s more about getting the blood pumping. It’s also suitable for a 3–4 PM workday break when your energy starts flagging. If you do sweat a little, you can always hand wash the light seal insert.Moving forward, I would love more apps that bring some light exercise to the platform — and Quest ports are a solid starting point. I would be curious to see how the system handles boxing and form-correcting, à la products like Tonal and Mirror.I wrote a bit about Apple’s Mindfulness app. It’s pretty bare-bones on the feature side, but that’s not a terrible thing in the world of meditation. I’ve also been trying out Endel Realms after a brief morning workout. I’ve written about Endel’s mobile app and how its algorithmically produced music has helped me get back into the meditation groove. Realms is a far simpler application at the moment, creating calming or energizing environments. You basically sit there for five to 10 minutes and let the light bath wash over you. I’ve so far found it to be centering.There are three things I want to see more of on the Vision Pro: dinosaurs, ocean exploration and space. I’ve mentioned Dinosaur Experience a few times on here, because it serves as a great example of what can be done with immersive, interactive technology. Being up close with dinosaur bodies that are based on the latest scientific research is one of those experiences that shows what a system like this is capable of.More than anything, however, it’s proof of concept. It’s short, plays and loops and the whole of its interactivity is limited to a butterfly landing on your finger and a trio of dinosaurs looking at you as you walk around. There’s not a ton of meat on this proverbial bone, but it’s beautiful, compelling and will hopefully point the way to bigger things.Image Credits: SkyGuideAs I wait for a guided tour through the solar system, I’m happy to spend some time with SkyGuide. The app operates similarly to NightSky on iPhone, providing an immersive look at the stars, constellations and planets. SkyGuide is a bit less tied to place than NightSky (which is honestly one of its best features) and is instead about simulating locations (a light-pollution-free cityscape, the top of a mountain range and the open ocean).Lego has been absolutely killing it with Nintendo AR demos. Builder’s Journey is an extremely pleasant experience that takes full advantage of the system’s object recognition, plopping a box of bricks directly on the table in front of you as you follow the storyline and build virtual structures.Loona occupies a similar space — albeit an even chiller one. This is what our Danish friends refer to as hygge. Here you’re piecing together some basic objects like a scooter or fireplace. It’s good for turning your brain off, though unfortunately you have to pay to unlock all but the first puzzle.Microsoft Word doesn’t bring much to the table on the immersion front, but if you plan to do some work inside the Vision Pro, the 40-year-old app remains a gold standard for word processing. As with any apps that entail a lot of typing, I strongly recommend pulling out a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Voice dictation still has its limitations, and while I’ve gotten pretty quick with gesture typing, the idea of using it to enter much more than a username and a password makes me want to jump off the roof.The coolest UI piece here is the addition of a small predictive text field that sits directly above the keyboard — more or less the same one you’ll find in iOS. Thus far, I’ve mostly limited longer form typing to sending off some emails.I’ve written a bit about Vision Pro enterprise apps over the last couple of weeks (as has Ron). My current take on the category is that it’s the place where Apple sees the highest and most immediate return on investment. Companies have deep pockets and they’ll buy products in bulk if they think it will save them in the long run. Bring on enough customers and you begin to approach a place where scale has a tangible impact on manufacturing prices.Training is a no-brainer. It can be especially useful for more complex tasks that require a three-dimensional understanding of objects in space. That last bit is also a fundamental aspect of JigSpace, which is designed to build AR demonstrations. Right out the gate, you can explore objects like a jet turbine, an F1 car and a human heart. The app offers a glimpse into how this tech might be used in the future.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/08/here-are-my-favorite-vision-pro-apps-so-far/\"],\n",

       "  'In this article, we will look at the 15 most respected countries in Asia. We have also looked at the ongoing and predicted economic growth of the Asian market. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Most Respected Countries in Asia.\\xa0Globally, the IMF projects a resilient growth rate of 3.1% for 2024 which is consistent with the previous year, although still below the historical average. Notably, inflation is expected to decline from 6.8% in 2023 to 4.4% in 2025. Turning to Asia, the region is on track to contribute two-thirds to global growth in 2024, with upward revisions in growth estimates for both 2023 (4.7%) and 2024 (4.5%), driven by factors such as policy stimulus and a supportive external environment.However, regional variations persist, as Japan\\'s growth is slowing from 2% in 2023 to about 1% in 2024, while India maintains strong growth at 6.5% in both 2024 and 2025. The inflation outlook in Asia is generally positive, with average inflation in the region falling from 3.8% in 2022 to 2.6% in 2023. China is facing concerns about deflation as it recorded inflation of only 0.3% in 2023, while Japan is expected to experience a slowdown but remain above the 2% inflation target until 2025.\\xa0South Asia\\'s economic trajectory, outlined in the World Bank\\'s latest update, reveals a noteworthy growth rate of just under 6 percent, outpacing other regions. However, despite this positive trend, achieving high-income status within a generation remains a formidable challenge. The region\\'s average potential growth hovers around 5 percent, falling short of the necessary 8 percent or higher required for rapid convergence with high-income countries by 2050. Private investment, a critical driver for such acceleration, has been uneven across South Asian nations, with some experiencing negative or stagnant growth while others, like India and Bangladesh, have witnessed robust expansion, albeit with potential challenges in sustaining public investment growth.Furthermore, fiscal vulnerabilities persist, as all South Asian countries grapple with persistently large fiscal deficits, resulting in accelerated government debt burdens since 2010. Additionally, the region stands as the most vulnerable among Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDE) to climate risks, with a significant population exposed to natural disasters in the past decade. Addressing these challenges demands a multifaceted approach, including fostering private investment, fortifying fiscal positions, and developing resilience to climate risks for sustained and cleaner growth in South Asia.Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\\xa0 is strategically expanding its presence in emerging markets, with the recent launch of an online store in Vietnam following the opening of physical shops in India. As growth in developed markets, including China, slows down, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) aims to tap into the potential of Southeast Asian economies like Vietnam, India, and Indonesia. CEO Tim Cook highlighted the company\\'s success in these markets, achieving all-time records in countries such as Mexico, Indonesia, and India. Analysts predict that over the coming years, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will increasingly focus on countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and India, which are poised to become major contributors to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s\\xa0 global market share.The move into Southeast Asia is also part of a broader trend among global businesses, as the region\\'s rising middle class presents a lucrative market opportunity. However, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) may face challenges due to the high price points of its products in less developed economies. While the company currently operates its own stores in more developed regional economies like Thailand and Singapore, it has yet to establish a physical presence in countries like Indonesia. Despite potential hurdles, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) aims to replicate its success in China by employing different pricing strategies to attract customers and build a loyal user base in Southeast Asia.vernon-raineil-cenzon-JZ7OowQQVgg-unsplashThe Human Development Index (HDI) 2021 measures a country\\'s well-being through factors like education, life expectancy, and income. On the other hand, respect for human rights, assessed by the Human Rights Index (V-Dem 2023), complements HDI by focusing on civil liberties and political freedoms. A country fostering both indices shows a balanced approach as it ensures citizens lead dignified lives with access to essential resources, education, and health, while also upholding fundamental rights. This synergy reflects a society where individuals thrive not only economically but also within a framework of justice and fairness, earning global respect for valuing both human development and rights.Hence, to list the most respected countries in Asia, we relied on the Human Development Index as well as the Human Rights Index for Asian countries. We averaged both indices to obtain an average index score. The list is now presented in ascending order.\\xa0Here is a list of the most respected countries in AsiaHuman Development Index: 0.911Human Rights Index: 0.35Average Index: 0.631In 2022, UAE had a GDP per capita of $53,708. As of 2023, the population of the UAE is estimated to be 9.97 million, with Emirati citizens making up approximately 11.6% of the total.

       "  'Just a week after Elon Musk’s $55 billion Tesla payday was struck down by a Delaware judge, a New York court dismissed a challenge to Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation package, which clocked in at under $100 million. Some coincidence.At face value, the two cases seem to have a lot in common. Both were shareholder suits waged against some of the highest-paid superstar tech CEOs in the world. And both were filed amid a backdrop of increased public scrutiny over executive compensation in recent years, which is near all-time highs across S&P 500 companies.But for all their similarities, from a legal standpoint the two cases are apples and oranges—and Cook was always going to stand a better chance of holding on to his paycheck.Elon Musk’s $55 billion compensation package at Tesla made headlines last month after Delaware chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled in favor of a shareholder who argued that Tesla was paying its CEO an unfairly high amount with the moonshot grant. Plaintiff Richard Tornetta argued that because Musk wields so much power at Tesla and maintains close relationships with his board members, the supposedly independent board of directors’ vote approving his massive pay scheme was anything but.“Chancellor McCormick found that the process for setting Elon Musk’s pay was essentially controlled by Elon Musk,” said Tulane University law professor Ann M. Lipton in an interview with Fortune. “The board didn’t engage in any kind of pushback or real bargaining.”In response, Musk has threatened to relocate Tesla from Delaware (where almost 70% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated) to Texas, where a more favorable political climate could leave him less exposed to these types of challenges.While the Musk case was focused on a broad, more abstract legal question related to the Tesla board of directors’ degree of independence, the Cook case resolved yesterday was much simpler.“The question before Delaware [in the Musk case] was simply, ‘Was the pay substantively unfair?’ whereas the question in the Tim Cook case was solely, ‘Was the proxy statement misleading?’” said Lipton.The Teamsters’ pension fund sued Apple last year, arguing that the company had misled investors by misrepresenting Cook’s 2021 and 2022 pay in its proxy statements and paying him more than it had initially proposed.Because Cook and other Apple executives are primarily paid in equity known as RSUs, the company enlists financial models to estimate what Cook’s actual pay will be for shareholders’ approval each year.(For CEOs, being compensated primarily with stock isn’t uncommon. Mark Zuckerberg famously earns just $1 in annual salary, but he’s made billions through Meta stock grants included in his compensation package. The Economic Policy Institute found in a report last year that stock-related pay accounts for over 80% of CEO compensation.)The pension fund that sued Cook argued that Apple misrepresented its CEO’s actual compensation package by downplaying the value of his equity. Cook and other Apple executives netted over $90 million in compensation for 2021 and 2022, higher than the $77.5 million estimate the company initially asked shareholders to vote on for approval.(Both of those figures are well below Cook’s current annual compensation; at his own request, the Apple CEO took a 40% pay cut last year. That change was approved by shareholders and the Apple board’s compensation committee, which counts former Vice President Al Gore as one of its members.)The plaintiffs claimed that Apple used an unusual financial model to artificially deflate Cook’s pay estimate, and also buried the compensation tables in a drab, gray section of the proxy statement, where shareholders would be less likely to notice it before casting their Say-on-Pay votes. The court didn’t buy it.“What happened with Tim Cook is very common in public companies,” said Marc Hodak, partner at executive compensation consultancy Farient Advisors. “They award performance shares based on the face value of the stock. And each of those performance share units has a market value that’s higher than the face value stock at the time of grant.”One key difference between the two cases was the size of the contested pay package. Musk’s $55 billion award from Tesla was part of the largest compensation plan in corporate history. While Cook’s $100 million annual pay is by no means a small sum, it’s on par with his peers. In fact, Apple uses a group of its competitors, including Meta, Netflix, Visa, and Cisco, to benchmark its executives’ compensation. (Notably, it added Tesla to that peer group last year.)“I don’t have any question that the size and scale of [Musk’s] pay package was a driver, both in terms of the litigation and the decision that we saw,” said Hodak. “[$55 billion] is automatically going to attract an unusual amount of scrutiny.”Taken together, these two cases do seem to hint at a broader trend toward greater scrutiny of bloated CEO pay—but Lipton advised against reading the tea leaves prematurely.“Elon Musk is beating this drum that everyone should leave Delaware, to suggest that somehow this is a trend,” said Lipton. “I think this is an Elon Musk problem. That Tim Cook thing, it was a different law. It was a different argument.”Representatives from Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com'],\n",

       "  \"Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, once said that “the best product doesn’t always win. The one everyone uses does.”It might seem strange to start a story about Alphabet with a quote from a Meta exec, but I couldn’t help thinking about Boz’s line while hearing Google execs preview their plans for today’s big public rollout of the company’s Gemini AI services. These allow people to interact with a chatbot powered by its Gemini models, as well as use generative AI features powered by the models in Google Docs, Gmail, and other Google Workspace products.Google likes to tout the most capable version of Gemini, which it calls Gemini Ultra 1.0, as the world’s most powerful AI model. It's true that Gemini is compatible with many different kinds of media: It can work with images, video, audio, and text better, and do so better than any other model. And according to self-reported results on more than two dozen benchmark tests, Gemini Ultra is marginally superior to OpenAI’s GPT-4 across a lot of language and reasoning tasks.Chirag Dekate, vice president and analyst at tech analytics firm Gartner, says that a lot of people mistakenly see Gemini as Google still trying to play catch-up with OpenAI and Microsoft, which had a head start with ChatGPT and GPT-4 powered Microsoft products such as Bing Chat and its Copilot tools in Word and PowerPoint.What people are missing, Dekate says, is that with Gemini’s multimodal capabilities, Google has leapfrogged the competition. And that Google has some advantages that its competitors will find hard to match. One is YouTube, whose vast video archive is a ready source of video training data that few other companies have and that Microsoft and OpenAI certainly can’t match.Another, according to Dekate, is Google is finally showing that its in-house AI “model generation” factory—powered by the merger of its two AI research labs DeepMind and Google Brain and the tying of the new combined Google DeepMind closer to product development teams—can churn out powerful new AI models fast, which may mean it will now be able to stay ahead, or at least not fall behind again.But what was clear from Google’s Gemini launch is that they are not counting on performance alone to win the AI chatbot wars. This is going to be a battle fought largely over three factors that have little to do with the AI models themselves: distribution, pricing, and business model.Google knows where it has a strategic advantage over its rivals at Microsoft and OpenAI, and leaned heavily on them in the Gemini rollout. Among its biggest advantages is Android. Google has entrée to 3.6 billion Android users globally. And it’s planning to make it super convenient for them to use Gemini as their preferred chatbot and AI assistant. Starting today, users in the U.S. will be able to make Gemini their go-to voice-based digital assistant on their phones, replacing the old Google Assistant. (They can also use it through an app if they prefer; iOS users must access it less conveniently through the Google app.) It will be rolling out this capability in select parts of Asia, supporting English, Korean, and Japanese soon.This is a distribution channel that Microsoft can’t match, so Google is wise to focus on it.The fact that iOS users cannot easily make Gemini their preferred voice assistant also shows how Apple’s “walled garden” approach to iOS continues to serve as a moat. In this case, it has bought Apple time to play catch-up and ditch the current version of Siri for an LLM-powered chatbot of Apple’s own making that can match GPT-4 and Gemini. Apple is, according to reporting from Bloomberg, working its own “Apple GPT” models that are designed to rival OpenAI’s and Google’s generative AI offerings.Google is also hoping that people who want to access Gemini Ultra will be willing to pay $20 a month for it as part of a Google One subscription that will also let users use Gemini-powered features in Google Workspace products, such as Google Docs and Sheets.This is pricey, but it is the same amount OpenAI charges for ChatGPT Plus subscribers, without the integration into office productivity tools, and $10 less than Microsoft charges users who want to access GPT-4 powered generative AI in Microsoft 365 products. Plus, Google One subscribers will get 2 TB of storage. Google is hoping this bundling of Gemini with other products will tip consumers toward subscribing to its AI services instead of OpenAI’s or Microsoft’s.A lot of enterprise customers of Workspace or Microsoft 365 will probably pay to access the generative AI features. But it’s unclear how many consumers are willing to pay this kind of money. They certainly won’t subscribe to more than one such AI chatbot. And there is also the question of whether they will want to use a different AI chatbot on their personal devices than the brand they use at work. A lot of people may want to use the same AI model they are accustomed to for both work and personal tasks.Fresh off quarterly earnings in which Alphabet showed its subscription businesses are finally starting to show some real growth, the company is eager to double down on the business model. This is in part to quiet investor concerns that generative AI ultimately kills Google’s largely ad-driven search business.Subscriptions make a lot of sense for AI services. People want to know when they ask their AI chatbot which new running shoes they should buy, the responses are based on what the bot knows about their personal preferences, weekly mileage, and weak knees—not what Nike paid to have its shoes mentioned first by the chatbot. The best way to align the interest of the companies building the bots and consumers is with a subscription model.But the irony here may be that Big Tech is falling in love with AI subscriptions, just as the streaming companies are falling out of love with their subscriptions because they’ve hit the limits of consumer wallets. This may foretell a brutal reckoning down the road for the premium chatbot services, too.Streaming was a business where product differentiation mattered. That’s why Netflix and Amazon and Apple and Disney spent billions on exclusive content. And that differentiation resulted in consumers feeling torn—they wanted to watch both The Queen’s Gambit and Ted Lasso. So, for a time, people were willing to pay for both Netflix and Apple TV.But here the tech companies are spending billions essentially to ensure there’s almost no product differentiation. Dekate’s comments about Gemini’s multimodal capabilities aside, the top AI chatbots all offer fairly similar capabilities.So the winner here is going to come down to distribution and price. And while Google’s opening moves in that regard look solid, they are a bit conservative. Google’s biggest weakness is its innovator’s dilemma. It has a huge ad business to defend, and most of the moves it makes with AI chatbots and personal assistants potentially cannibalize it. On the other hand, it has a huge ad business that could subsidize a cut-price AI offering. If I were Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, I’d be thinking hard about dropping Gemini’s $20 per month price tag and coming in even lower, at $15 per month or even less.As Dekate points out, another advantage Google has is that it runs all of its AI applications on its own bespoke hardware, TPUs. That means it can potentially control its computing costs better than Microsoft, which is primarily reliant on Nvidia’s expensive and energy-hungry chips to run its AI services, or OpenAI, which runs its services on Microsoft’s cloud too. That, in turn, should allow Alphabet to run its AI offerings with higher operating margins.One thing is clear: The AI chatbot wars are just getting started.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com\"],\n",

A Justice Department spokesperson confirmed receipt of Comer’s letter, but would not comment on its claims or other content.Registration under the Foreign Agents Registration Act requires disclosures from people or companies that may be engaging in propaganda activities for or on behalf of foreign governments, parties or other institutions.Comer also noted reports that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has demanded, on national security grounds, that TikTok’s Chinese owners sell their shares in the company; that the US military prohibited members from using TikTok on government-issued devices, signaling security risk concerns; and that the Biden administration has since extended the ban to all federal employees.In his letter, Comer demanded documents by Feb. 22 related to TikTok’s or Al Jazeera’s FARA registration status, and any communications about how DOJ decides whether to sue or prosecute for failure to register.--With assistance from Emily Birnbaum.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekOpenAI’s Secret Weapon Is Sam Altman’s 33-Year-Old LieutenantHow Jack Dorsey’s Plan to Get Elon Musk to Save Twitter Went SouthInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went WrongThe Story Elon Musk Doesn’t Want to Talk AboutA Tiny Fund Takes a Big Short on Corporate Debt Maturity Wall©2024 Bloomberg L.P.'],\n",

As the\\xa0markets surge to two-year highs, they continue to have narrow leadership. Indeed, the Magnificent Seven, excluding\\xa0Tesla\\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA), has been spearheading the uptrend. In all honesty, their leadership is warranted since they are the main AI beneficiaries. Furthermore, they have shown significant progress in monetizing the technology.Also, with uncertainties on the horizon related to U.S. elections and monetary policy, investors are piling into Dow components.

This month Apple\\xa0launched its latest product, the Apple Vision Pro, highlighting its leadership in consumer electronics. Amid the impressive reviews, developers have also stepped up, releasing 600 new apps built for the device.The company’s ability to launch products that define entire categories—be it the iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch—underscores its core strength.

In 2023, it maintained its number-one position in equity and equity-related underwriting and announced and completed mergers and acquisitions. Considering its leadership in investment banking and markets, Goldman is one of the best Dow Stocks for the next bull run.Over the past two years, Goldman has seen a significant dent in revenues due to the\\xa0IPO drought\\xa0in 2022 and 2023. The investment bank’s bread and butter is equity and debt underwriting as well as mergers and acquisitions advisory.

For instance, in 2023, major IPOs like\\xa0Arm Holdings\\xa0(NASDAQ:ARM) were well received having\\xa0successful debuts. These debuts can lead to stronger deal activity this year.Furthermore, with monetary policy stabilizing hence reducing uncertainty, business could accelerate. Already, optimism is rising as the company announced a significant increase in its advisory backlog in its Q4 2023 earnings call.If the bull market continues, it will spur a lot of IPOs, debt issuance and mergers. The prowess of Goldman Sachs in these areas means it will capture a significant portion of this activity advising clients.

       "  'Steve Jobs, the iconic figure behind Apple Inc., was known for his eccentric lifestyle choices. He lived on his terms, distinct from societal norms.Jobs had a diet that significantly influenced his personal and professional life. His dietary habits included fasting for days, followed by consuming simple leafy vegetables and water. He was known for spending weeks eating the same type of food, such as apples or carrot salads, and then abruptly stopping or going on a fast.During a period of following a fruitarian diet, Jobs reportedly visited an apple orchard and the experience inspired the company name Apple. He considered the name to be \"fun, spirited and not intimidating,\" a sentiment Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak shared. They ultimately decided on this name for their company.Don\\'t Miss:Did you know StartEngine Private is your portal to investing in venture-backed businesses without spending millions?Join the ranks of investors like Bill Gates and Mark Cuban by tapping into early-stage startups. Get the inside scoop on this innovative startup here.Jobs\\'s fruit-based diet resulted in another theory that he was very wrong about.Walter Isaacson\\'s biography of Jobs indicates that Jobs felt showers were unnecessary for someone who ate a clean, fruit-based diet. He also believed there was no need for deodorant. This led to some issues at Atari Corp., where his colleagues were disturbed by his body odor, resulting in Jobs being moved to the night shift.It wasn\\'t just at Atari. Former Apple CEO Mike Markkula informed Isaacson that he and the team insisted Jobs take showers before allowing him to participate in meetings.Jobs\\'s disregard for conventional hygiene practices, as noted in his biography, was not the only quirk of his habits. He was also known for his constant nail-biting, a habit that might be seen as an outlet for the intense pressure and stress that came with his position as a leading innovator in the tech industry.Trending: Cheddar was acquired for $200 million yielding a return of 370.37% for its investors. This startup aims to replicate and potentially surpass this success.The most visually defining aspect of Jobs\\'s habits was his iconic uniform: a black turtleneck, blue jeans and New Balance sneakers. This choice was influenced by his visit to Japan in the 1980s, where he was inspired by the concept of a uniform after seeing Sony\\'s employees.Initially, Jobs attempted to introduce a uniform at Apple, but after facing rejection, he adopted his own uniform, designed by Issey Miyake. Jobs kept over a hundred black turtlenecks, which cost $175 at the time, simplifying his daily choices and creating an iconic image that became synonymous with his brand.Jobs\\'s habits, from his unusual approach to hygiene to his constant nail-biting and adoption of a minimalist uniform, paint the picture of a man who was not only a technological visionary but also a person with idiosyncrasies.These habits underline the principle that innovation and genius often come with unconventional traits. Jobs\\'s legacy in technology is unparalleled, yet his quirks offer a more nuanced understanding of the man behind the Apple brand, highlighting the complexities that can exist behind a public persona.Read Next:This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch?Here is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden.\"ACTIVE INVESTORS\\' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?APPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis ReportTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article Steve Jobs Didn\\'t Think He Needed To Shower Because He Only Ate Fruit — But His Body Odor Had Him Banished To The Night Shift When Colleagues Complained About The Smell originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Microsoft also reported its strongest profit growth in more than two years as it continues to infuse AI across its business and offerings.Apple posted revenue grew 2% YoY to\\xa0$119.6 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of\\xa0$117.91 billion.\\xa0Apple also reported record earnings per share of $2.18, also topping $2.11 that analysts had predicted.\\xa0Net income rose 13% to\\xa0$34 billion.Net iPhone sales grew\\xa0almost 6%\\xa0YoY to\\xa0$69.7 billion\\xa0while\\xa0global iPad sales dropped to $7 billion, down from $9 billion reported for 2022’s comparable quarter.While sales in Europe and Japan rose, revenue in China slumped 13% YoY to\\xa0$20.8 billion.\\xa0Demand in China has slowed more than expected in response to rising competition from Huawei as well as Beijing restriction on its products.\\xa0According to Counterpoint Research, overall China smartphone sales grew 6.6%\\xa0and although Apple maintained its leadership with 20.2% market share, its sales dropped 9% while Huawei experienced a sales rise of as much as 71%.But the services segment that houses its App Store, iCloud, Apple Pay and Apple TV, continues to be a rising star as its revenue grew 11% YoY to 23.1 billion.The iPhone might\\xa0no longer be the best indicator of Apple’s health...Services were undoubtedly the star of the latest quarterly report that came one day after Apple’s biggest product launch in about a decade- the Vision Pro headset. Priced at $3,499, Apple spent an estimated $100 billion to develop this product it hopes to become the must-have piece of home electronics. More importantly, this product is the ultimate opportunity for Tim Cook to make his own Apple legacy.Moreover, Apple splurged on its AppleTV+ content and it has scored it as many as 13 Academy Award nominations, with ten of them being for the Killers of The Flower Moon. But, this is kind of expected as Apple built its biggest movie industry bet with the\\xa0all-time-great\\xa0director, screenwriter and producer,\\xa0Mr.\\xa0Martin Scorsese.Apple posted strong numbers and it showed that services continue to grow and become a bigger part of the tech giant’s business, but China is a lingering concern. In response to this slowdown in China, Apple even offered a rare discount for its latest iPhone in January. Cook also confirmed that generative AI software features are coming on Apple’s iOS and other platforms later this year, which is only to be expected considering that Microsoft, Google and Samsung’s latest figures were fueled by such enhancements. But considering that Apple is known for being secretive about its next moves, Cook’s confirmation and tease could mean that Apple’s AI plans are ambitious, to say the least. After all, there’s nothing artificial about AI and generative AI’s business potential nor the the latest\\xa0figures that Microsoft and Google posted, and this is just the beginning of a new era that is in the making.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

       "  'PayPal is working on a new consumer app for its mobile customers, and suggested that it will be \"ready\" to take advantage of the new EU regulation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), when it goes into effect next month for tech \"gatekeepers,\" like Apple. For PayPal, one of the significant changes coming in the DMA is the ability for third-party apps to access the NFC technology that currently powers Apple Pay in their own mobile wallet applications. iPhone users will also be able to switch to another mobile wallet as their default, under the new guidelines.On its Q4 earnings call, PayPal didn\\'t share much about its plans concerning Apple\\'s compliance with the DMA or how it would impact PayPal specifically. In part, that\\'s because Apple is a company PayPal works closely with today, offering checkout and payment services on Apple devices, from Macs to iPhones, as well as integrations with Apple Wallet, including support for \"Tap to Pay\" contactless payments which leverage Apple Wallet.Noted PayPal CEO Alex Chriss, a former Intuit exec who started his new role at PayPal in September, \"We are tracking this closely,\" in response to an investor question about how PayPal would be taking advantage of the new access to the NFC technology the DMA allows for. \"Apple is a great partner of ours,\" he added.However, Chriss also suggested that PayPal customers have been looking for a way to use PayPal outside the world of online payments and that the company was working on delivering this.\"...our customers that love PayPal on the online e-commerce side are demanding being able to have an omnichannel and offline solution, as well. So, we\\'ll be working closely on this. And when it is available, we will be ready to be able to deliver for our customers, both online and offline,\" he responded.It\\'s not a clear answer, but one that certainly suggests the payments giant is working on something in the area of NFC mobile wallets, particularly given the \"offline solution\" comment.Offline payments, meaning those taking place in physical retail stores, is an area PayPal has unsuccessfully tried to expand into for years. Over the past decade, PayPal has tried a range of initiatives on this front, including partnerships with national retailers in the U.S., deals with point-of-sale software and terminal makers, features to pay local shops via its app, acquisitions of mobile wallet technology, the use of QR codes for retailer payments, partnerships with credit cards on offline payments, tools for merchants selling offline and more.But although the COVID-19 pandemic drove faster adoption of contactless payments, Apple Pay remained the top mobile payment player, at least in the U.S.As for the EU, Europe has a high mobile wallet penetration, with one 2023 study noting that a majority (72%) actively engage with the technology. Another analysis says Europe\\'s mobile payments market size is estimated to reach $108.35 billion in 2024, then $373.29 billion by 2029. While Apple and Google have gained ground here, 90% of Europeans have used PayPal services, the study said.Simply put, PayPal has a sizable opportunity to capitalize on Apple\\'s loosened rules in the days ahead, if it chooses.Apple\\'s DMA-driven changes will include new APIs that let app developers use NFC technology in their banking and mobile wallet apps throughout the EU. Plus, Apple is adding new controls that would allow consumers to select a third-party contactless payment app as their new default. In other words, PayPal could be swapped in for Apple Pay, if it adopts this functionality.Chriss didn\\'t share when PayPal would implement the \"offline\" solution the DMA would enable, only saying that the company would be \"ready\" to do so, at some point after the new functionality became available.Possibly related to this, PayPal also offered hints of a new consumer app in development at the company.\"This year, we\\'re launching and evolving a new PayPal app to create habituation,\" noted Chriss.Later, he also admitted that PayPal\\'s \"mobile experience for our consumers, has been underwhelming. And it\\'s something that with the new innovations we just rolled out, I expect for us to be able to continue to see improvement there,\" he added.Recently, PayPal introduced a series of AI-powered features, including personalized cashback offers in the app and smart receipts that offer suggestions of what to buy next from the same brand, for example. These features and others were announced as part of a \"first look\" experience in January, which Chriss said was done in 60 days, instead of the \"months or years\" they could have taken.Investors didn\\'t dig in to ask more DMA or mobile wallet-related questions, but the company already announced when select new features would launch, like CashPass (personalized cashback) due out in March, with Smart Receipts said to be coming soon.PayPal in Q4 beat on earnings with EPS of $1.48, above the $1.36 expected, and revenue of $8.03 billion, ahead of the $7.87 billion expected. The stock dropped after the earnings announcement, however, because of weaker-than-expected first-quarter guidance.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/08/paypal-suggests-it-will-be-ready-to-offer-offline-payments-when-dma-goes-into-effect/'],\n",

       "  'Your phone\\'s camera is as much software as it is hardware, and Glass is hoping to improve both. But while its wild anamorphic lens creeps to market, the company (running on $9.3 million in new money) has released an AI-powered camera upgrade that it says vastly improves image quality — without any weird AI upscaling artifacts.GlassAI is a purely software approach to improving images, what they call a neural image signal processor (ISP). ISPs are basically what take the raw sensor output — often flat, noisy, and distorted — and turn that into the sharp, colorful images we see.The ISP is also increasingly complex, as phone makers like Apple and Google like to show, synthesizing multiple exposures, quickly detecting and sharpening faces, adjusting for tiny movements, and so on. And while many include some form of machine learning or AI, they have to be careful: using AI to generate detail can produce hallucinations or artifacts as the system tries to create visual information where none exists. Such \"super-resolution\" models are useful in their place, but they have to be carefully monitored.Glass makes both a full camera system based on an unusual lozenge-shaped front element, and an ISP to back it up. And while the former is working towards market presence with some upcoming devices, the latter is, it turns out, a product worth selling in its own right.Glass rethinks the smartphone camera through an old-school cinema lens\"Our restoration networks correct optical aberrations and sensor issues while efficiently removing noise, and outperform traditional Image Signal Processing pipelines at fine texture recovery,\" explained CTO and co-founder Tom Bishop in their news release.Concept animation showing process of going from RAW to Glass-processed image.The word \"recovery\" is key, because details are not simply created but extracted from raw imagery. Depending on how your camera stack already works, you may know that certain artifacts or angles or noise patterns can be reliably resolved or even taken advantage of. Learning how to turn these implied details into real ones — or combining details from multiple exposures — is a big part of any computational photography stack. Co-founder and CEO Ziv Attar says their neural ISP is better than any in the industry.Even Apple, he pointed out, doesn\\'t have a full neural image stack, only using it in specific circumstances where it\\'s needed, and their results (in his opinion) aren\\'t great. He provided an example of Apple\\'s neural ISP failing to interpret text correctly, with Glass faring much better:Photo provided by Ziv Attar showing an iPhone 15 Pro Max zoomed to 5x, and the Glass-processed version of the phone\\'s RAW images.\"I think its fair too assume that if Apple hasn’t managed to get decent results, it is a hard problems to solve,\" he said. \"It\\'s less about the actual stack but more about how you train. We have a very unique way of doing it, which was developed for the anamorphic lens systems and is efficient at any camera. Basically, we have training labs that involve robotics systems and optical calibration systems that manage to train a network to characterize the aberration of lenses in a very comprehensive way, and fundamentally reversing any optical distortion.\"As an example, he provided a case study where they had DXO evaluate the camera on a Moto Edge 40, then do so again with GlassAI installed. The Glass-processed images are all clearly improved, sometimes dramatically so.Image Credits: Glass / DXOAt low light levels the built-in ISP struggles to differentiate fine lines, textures, and facial details in its night mode. Using GlassAI, it\\'s as sharp as a tack even with half the exposure time.You can go peep the pixels on a few test photos Glass has available by switching between the raws and the finals.Companies putting together phones and cameras have to spend a lot of time tuning the ISP so that the sensor, lens, and other bits and pieces all work together properly to make the best image possible. It seems, however, that Glass\\'s one-size-fits-all process might do a better job in a fraction of the time.\"The time it takes us to train shippable software from the time we put our hands on a new type of device... it varies between few hours to few days. For reference, phone makers spend months tuning for image quality, with huge teams. Our process is fully automated so we can support multiple devices in a few days,\" said Attar.The neural ISP is also end-to-end, meaning in this context that it goes straight from sensor RAW to final image with no extra processes like denoising, sharpening, and so on needed.Left: RAW, right: Glass-processed.When I asked, Attar was careful to differentiate their work from super-resolution AI services, which take a finished image and upscale it. These often aren\\'t \"recovering\" details so much as inventing them where it seems appropriate, a process that can sometimes produce undesirable results. Though Glass uses AI, it isn\\'t generative the way many image-related AIs are.Today marks the product\\'s availability at large, presumably after a lengthy testing period with partners. If you make an Android phone, it might be good to at least give it a shot.On the hardware side, the phone with the weird lozenge-shaped anamorphic camera will have to wait until that manufacturer is ready to go public, though.While Glass develops its tech and trying out customers, it\\'s also been busy scaring up funding. The company just closed a $9.3 million \"extended Seed,\" which I put in quotes because the seed round was in 2021. The new funding was led by GV, with Future Ventures, Abstract Ventures, and LDV Capital participating.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/08/glass-supercharges-smartphone-cameras-with-ai-minus-the-hallucinations/'],\n",

       "  '(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech is bringing in more cash than ever before, priming the group to return money to shareholders and potentially adding fuel to a rally that’s already sent most of the group into record territory.Most Read from BloombergA 99% Bond Wipeout Hands Hedge Funds a Harsh Lesson on ChinaUkraine’s Army Chief Replaced After Rift With ZelenskiyEpstein Contacted Staley for Years at Barclays Using Go-Between, Court Filings ClaimBonds Fall After $25 Billion Sale as Stocks Churn: Markets WrapEinhorn Says Markets ‘Fundamentally Broken’ By Passive, Quant InvestingThe five biggest technology companies that have reported earnings so far — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. — generated a record $139.5 billion of combined cash from operations in the quarter that ended on Dec. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Investors can “expect excess free cash flow to largely be returned to shareholders given these companies already possess strong balance sheets and high net cash positions,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. “Greater focus on capital returns will help contribute to shareholder value over time and is better than holding onto excess cash on the balance sheet.”Only Apple, Microsoft and now Meta have dividend plans in this group. While having cash in the bank is a good position to be in, investors appreciate when companies invest any excess money for better opportunities or return it to shareholders.In some ways, it has become more challenging for the firms to spend it. Amazon last month abandoned a $1.4 billion purchase of Roomba maker iRobot Corp. after clashing with European Union regulators. Microsoft eventually completed its $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard, but only after two-years of trans-Atlantic scrutiny that threatened to scupper the deal.Buybacks on the other hand are seen as a way to return profits to investors while reducing the number of shares outstanding — theoretically increasing the value of the remaining stock.Such moves enable firms to demonstrate that they are profitable, well-performing and believe their shares are still undervalued. “The confidence signaled by the payment or increase of a dividend can be a powerful boost to sentiment,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.Read More: Meta’s $197 Billion Surge Is Biggest in Stock-Market HistoryMeta showed what aggressive capital returns can do when it initiated a quarterly dividend and earmarked $50 billion in funds for share repurchases. Aided by a stronger than expected sales forecast, its stock on Friday saw the biggest single-day market value gain in market history.“You rewind 10 years ago when a tech company starts giving a dividend — it’s usually the beginning of the end of growth,” Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said in an interview. But Meta’s dividend came alongside continued investments signaling “they believe they can achieve growth in AI and Reality Labs by doing this themselves,” he said, referring to the unit building the firm’s version of the metaverse.Still, there are also reasons for investor caution, notes AJ Bell’s Mould, citing how buybacks can be used to juice earnings per share figures by reducing share count, for example.Big Tech has spent about $186 billion on buybacks over the last 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta have consistently spent billions in buying back stock, Amazon has been a notable hold out recently.The e-commerce giant is one of the most obvious candidates to increase its capital returns. It generated a record $42.5 billion in cash in the fourth quarter but didn’t repurchase any shares and doesn’t pay a dividend. Its cash and cash equivalents are at about $87 billion, just shy of a 2021 record.“Stock buybacks are more likely to be the norm to boost EPS,” said Ted Mortonson, technology desk sector strategist at Baird. “In the ‘new GenAI’ world, paying a dividend will not be a signal of growth deceleration.”Tech Chart of the DayArm Holdings Plc jumps as much as 41% on Thursday, its biggest intraday rise on record, after the chip designer’s third-quarter results surged past expectations, allowing the company to boost its full-year forecast.

       "  \"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology is expected to positively impact multiple industries in the long run, creating a massive annual revenue opportunity worth $1.3 trillion in 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Nvidia\\xa0has been the go-to stock for investors looking to capitalize on this lucrative market. Shares of the company have jumped 205% in the past year as the solid demand for its graphics cards has led to a terrific increase in its revenue and earnings. That's not surprising as Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) form the basic building blocks for training AI applications because of their immense computing power.As it turns out, the demand for Nvidia's graphics cards is so strong that customers are reportedly waiting for as long as a year to get their hands on the company's hardware. Not surprisingly, Nvidia is expected to deliver another year of terrific growth and its stock could keep rising thanks to the company's dominant share of the fast-growing AI chip market.However, certain investors may think that they have missed the Nvidia gravy train because of the expensive valuation it trades at. The company's price-to-sales ratio of 37 and the trailing earnings multiple of 87 are not in value territory. However, investors can buy chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS), which is known for supplying chips for Apple's\\xa0iPhones, at a much cheaper valuation.Let's see how AI could supercharge Skyworks stock.Skyworks Solutions sells radio frequency (RF) semiconductors that are deployed in multiple markets ranging from automotive to aerospace to defense, but smartphones are its bread and butter. Apple is Skyworks' biggest customer as the iPhone maker produced 66% of its total revenue in the previous fiscal year.Too much reliance on a single customer isn't a good thing, which is evident from the tepid top- and bottom-line performance Skyworks delivered in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 29, 2023). Apple's smartphone shipments increased just 3.7% in 2023 in a tough smartphone market, and Skyworks bore the brunt of this modest growth as its fiscal 2023 revenue fell 13% during the year to $4.77 billion.Skyworks' performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on Dec. 29, 2023) wasn't great either. Its revenue fell 10% year over year to $1.2 billion. The chipmaker's non-GAAP diluted earnings were down to $1.97 per share from $2.59 per share in the preceding year. Additionally, Skyworks' revenue guidance of $1.02 to $1.07 billion for the current quarter points toward a 10% drop from the year-ago quarter at the midpoint.All this explains why Skyworks stock has dropped almost 11% in the past year, underperforming the broader semiconductor sector by a wide margin. However, the adoption of generative AI-enabled smartphones could turn out to be a tailwind for Skyworks Solutions and help turn the company's business around.Various estimates suggest that the generative AI smartphone market is set to gain impressive traction. Market research firm Counterpoint Research forecasts that sales of generative AI smartphones could reach 100 million units this year. By 2027, the size of this market is predicted to increase to 522 million units. In all, a total of 1 billion generative AI smartphones are anticipated to be sold during this period.On the other hand, investment bank UBS expects generative AI smartphone shipments to increase from 50 million units last year to 583 million units in 2027. It is worth noting that UBS says that generative AI smartphone penetration will stand at 46% in 2027, which means that this market will still have a lot of room for growth.Apple, which was the top smartphone original equipment manufacturer (OEM) globally last year with a 20.1% market share, is in a solid position to make the most of this fast-growing opportunity. Apple sold just over 234 million smartphones last year. The company's annual shipments could jump significantly to 460 million units in 2027 if it manages to increase its share of the smartphone market to 25%, driven by the integration of AI features into its upcoming iPhone.Given Skyworks' tight relationship with Apple, the chipmaker could ride the coattails of its largest client and return to growth. This is exactly what analysts anticipate from Skyworks over the next fiscal years.As the chart above indicates, Skyworks' revenue is anticipated to start growing from fiscal 2025, followed by an acceleration in fiscal 2026. The top-line improvement is expected to lead to stronger earnings growth as well.Skyworks sports a five-year average earnings multiple of 19. Assuming a similar earnings multiple in 2026, Skyworks' stock price could jump to $189 if it indeed hits the $9.96 earnings-per-share estimate seen in the chart above. That would be an 87% increase from current levels.Given that Skyworks stock is currently trading at just 18 times earnings right now, savvy investors would do well to buy this potential AI winner before it starts soaring.Should you invest $1,000 in Skyworks Solutions right now?Before you buy stock in Skyworks Solutions, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Skyworks Solutions wasn’t one of them.

       "  'The\\xa0streaming stocks\\xa0have been quite a mixed bag in recent quarters, with the streaming king and pioneer\\xa0Netflix\\xa0(NASDAQ:NFLX) continuing to surge above and beyond expectations. Indeed, the sheer strength in NFLX stock makes it seem like we’re living back in the days of FAANG. As Netflix’s rally gets long in the tooth, many investors may wonder what’s up next for the streaming scene, as ads, video games, generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), and “immersive” spatial content are thrown into the mix.Though streaming is no longer “magical,” I believe the market is primed for growth as new platforms and media experience growth over the coming year and beyond. With that, let’s check in with three streaming stocks I wouldn’t dare bet against as streaming looks to make its biggest pivot in a decade.Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.comApple\\xa0(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a slow mover into the streaming space, but it’s a tortoise that investors shouldn’t count out of the race as it looks to bolster its impressive services business. I believe the Vision Pro spatial computer launch could be a boon for its streaming service, Apple TV+. Not only can you view videos from the platform via a digital screen on Vision Pro, but there’s a very intriguing, albeit quite limited,\\xa0selection of immersive content.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple Immersive is what Apple’s calling it, and it’s only available on Vision Pro devices. For now, the immersive content is excellent to “show off” to prospective buyers looking to try the device at the local Apple Store. However, in a few years, I’d be unsurprised if the Apple Immersive library swells in size, perhaps by enough for users to justify paying up for their own Vision Pro.Though Apple TV+ is relatively lightweight in the streaming scene today, I’d not be shocked to see it make a run for Netflix’s crown if spatial computing and immersive content gain in adoption over the next five years. Personally, I view Apple as a streamer that’s thinking years ahead of the pack.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comNetflix stock’s jaw-dropping performance over the past two years warrants the respect of growth investors and perhaps even a round of applause. The stock is up over 230% since its May 2022 low and isn’t showing any signs of cooling off as the company continues to do its best to entertain customers in what is a new era of growth for the firm.The company has proven to the world that it can stay ahead of the pack, even as new streaming rivals look to steal its lunch. As products like Apple Vision Pro drag consumers into the realm of 3D content, I couldn’t be more excited for the future growth prospects of the streamers. For now, Netflix is sitting on the sidelines, with no plans (at least not yet) to launch an app for the Vision Pro. Netflix now views Apple’s spatial computer as a “subscale.”As more users adopt the technology, it’s a matter of time before Netflix lands on Vision Pro, perhaps with some 3D content similar to the immersive content currently available via Apple TV+. Of course, Apple must prove that its headset and immersive content are lucrative enough to bring in the big bucks.Only time will tell if immersive content pays off in these early innings of spatial computing. Either way, I’m sure Netflix will be keeping tabs as the streaming industry evolves to make good use of nascent technologies.Source: chrisdorney / ShutterstockFinally, we have\\xa0Disney\\xa0(NYSE:DIS), an entertainment and media firm that’s lost its way in recent years. Unlike Netflix, Disney has embraced the Vision Pro in its early stages, with its streaming app, Disney+, available on visionOS alongside its impressive content library. Though Vision Pro remains a niche product today, Disney is wise to be getting into the spatial computing scene ahead of some of its peers.Of course, Disney+ has been a\\xa0costly\\xa0double-edged sword for the company in recent years. And though immersive content could be the realm that allows the firm to bring some magic back to the ailing firm, investors ought to be patient as Disney does its best to turn things around.In the meantime, DIS stock investors seem rattled by recent shifts in the sports streaming market. As Disney joins forces with other streamers, such fears are unwarranted. Disney’s sports edge could be taken to the next level with some partners’ help.On the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Apple and Disney.

All told, Meta soared 20.5% last week, Amazon gained 8%, and Apple lost 3.4%.Still, I\\'d rather buy Apple than Meta or Amazon right now. Here\\'s why I believe the consumer tech giant has what it takes to compound over time.For its fiscal 2024\\'s first quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), Apple reported all-time-high diluted earnings per share of $2.18, up 16% from the year-ago period. Product revenue was up less than 0.1%, but services revenue rose 11.3%, so total sales gained 2.1%.Apple estimated that product supply constraints and one less week in this quarter, versus the same quarter last year, resulted in 2 percentage points of lower revenue. Still, 4% revenue growth isn\\'t impressive.Net Sales by RegionQ1 fiscal 2023Q1 fiscal 2024Year-Over-Year ChangeAmericas$49.3 billion$50.4 billion2.3%Europe$27.7 billion$30.4 billion9.8%Greater China$23.9 billion$20.8 billion(12.9%)Japan$6.8 billion$7.8 billion14.9%Rest of Asia Pacific$9.5 billion$10.2 billion6.5%Total Net Sales$117.2 billion$119.6 billion2.1%Data source: Apple. Chart by author.The glaring red flag in Apple\\'s report was China. Revenue from the iPhone set all-time records in Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, and South Korea, along with India and Indonesia. But that growth was weighed down by nearly 13% lower sales in China.Here\\'s where the math gets interesting. If you take out China, sales for fiscal 2024\\'s first quarter would have been up 5.9% from the year-ago period. If you also add in the additional 2 percentage points of sales headwind that Apple estimated because there was one additional week in the same quarter last year, revenue growth would have been 7.9%.That\\'s far more reasonable than the 2.1% face-value figure. Of course, taking out Apple\\'s third-largest region and second-largest country is a bit of a stretch. But if you believe that China will recover and that growth in emerging markets is sticky, Apple\\'s results are far better than they look at first glance.Apple did an excellent job of managing costs and growing margins. Despite less than 0.1% in product sales growth, product cost of sales fell by over $2.3 billion. Overall, the gross margin improved to 45.6%, compared to 43% in fiscal 2023\\'s first quarter. This marked an all-time high and showcased why the growth of services is turning Apple into even more of a cash cow.In the earnings call, Apple touted its record performance in services and iPhone sales growth across many new markets. The company also reinforced its sustainability goals by offering carbon-neutral Apple Watches and other efforts to progress toward its 2030 net-zero carbon goal.The tech giant\\'s installed base of Apple devices reached an all-time high of 2.2 billion. The company also reported a record number of iPhone upgrades in the quarter. Apple now has over 1 billion paid subscriptions across its services, more than double the number four years ago.Critics who point to Apple\\'s slowing growth should note that Apple stock is up just 7% over the last two years. Yet today, it\\'s a far higher-margin, higher-quality business than just two years ago. The growth may not be there, but the reasons for the slowdown are understandable. And the strength from services gives Apple plenty of momentum to boost its margins even further in the years to come.Apple is guiding for a gross margin of 46% to 47% in the second quarter. It\\'s also guiding for a double-digit services revenue growth.Note that a year ago, Apple\\'s fiscal 2023 second quarter benefited from alleviated supply chain constraints that led to higher inventory and the fulfillment of pent-up demand. The quarter was, in many ways, an artificially solid quarter. In fact, Apple estimates that the tailwind added around $5 billion in revenue to the quarter last year.The company expects its iPhone revenue and total company revenue for the latest quarter to be similar to the year-ago quarter but without that tailwind. Apple is essentially saying it expects fiscal 2024\\'s Q2 revenue to be $89.8 billion -- down from $94.8 billion a year ago.Apple made $20.1 billion in buybacks, compared to $19.5 billion in fiscal 2023\\'s first quarter. It also paid $3.8 billion in dividends, just slightly more than a year ago. Yes, you read that correctly: Apple\\'s buyback program is over five times bigger than its dividend program.For context, if Apple used the money it was paying in buybacks on the dividend instead, the company would have paid $1.26 per share in dividends this quarter -- good for a forward yield of 2.8%. This exercise shows the sheer size of Apple\\'s capital return program and why looking at the dividend without the context of buybacks is a big mistake.Buybacks have been a better use of capital than dividends. Buying back stock in a quality company is a good use of capital if the stock price goes up. But it also has immediate benefits by reducing the outstanding share count and, therefore, boosting earnings per share since there are fewer shares to go around.In this vein, Apple\\'s buybacks are a way to boost earnings-per-share growth, even when organic growth is stagnating. It\\'s another lever that Apple routinely pulls on to make it a worthwhile long-term investment.Overall, Apple\\'s quarter and guidance weren\\'t that great so understandably, investors with short-term time horizons could be running for the exits. But Apple\\'s long-term investment thesis has arguably gotten even stronger. And for that reason, Apple is worth buying now.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

       "  'The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a nickname given to the seven largest tech companies on the market: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia, and Tesla. Over the past decade, the worst-performing stock out of the seven is Alphabet -- and it\\'s up over 400%. Considering their performances, the nickname for the collective is warranted.Each company in the Magnificent Seven is a market leader in its own right, and there are legitimate bullish investing cases for each. However, if there were one stock from the bunch that you could be the surest of over the long run, it\\'s Microsoft. Here\\'s why.Each company in the Magnificent Seven has a specific product or service that serves as its bread and butter. The iPhone is 58% of Apple\\'s revenue; Google advertising is more than three-fourths of Alphabet\\'s revenue; advertising is 96% of Meta\\'s revenue; and GPUs make up most of Nvidia\\'s revenue.The story is a bit different with Microsoft. Here\\'s a breakdown of the company\\'s fiscal 2024 second-quarter earnings (ended Dec. 31).In its latest quarter, Microsoft made $62 billion in revenue (up 17.6% year over year). Its largest business segment, Intelligent Cloud, only accounted for around 41% of it. Even then, Microsoft\\'s Intelligent Cloud segment is fairly broad and includes cloud service Azure and other server products.Microsoft\\'s Productivity and Business Processes segment includes its Office and Dynamics products and LinkedIn. Its More Personal Computing segment includes Windows, Xbox, search and news advertising, and other devices. So even though Microsoft categorizes its business into three broad segments, many products and services make up its broad and diversified ecosystem.Having a diverse business is great and has its benefits. Not many people would argue against that point. What\\'s better, though, is having a diverse business that other corporations and businesses rely on to run their businesses. The latter is the case for Microsoft.Countless companies globally rely on Windows, Office products, Azure, LinkedIn, and other services for their operations. This gives Microsoft a buffer during rough economic times.When the economy isn\\'t the best and consumers need to be more price conscious, it\\'s relatively easy to say no to the latest iPhone, cut back on online shopping, or reduce an advertising budget. It\\'s more challenging for companies to switch to new operating systems, migrate from the cloud back to on-premise solutions, or not recruit on LinkedIn.Microsoft\\'s business may not be as flashy as some of the other Magnificent Seven stocks, but there\\'s no doubt that it continues to be a cash cow. Its $21.9 billion in net income is the second-highest of the Magnificent Seven, trailing only Apple. Having net income growth outpace revenue growth by so much shows the company is operating and scaling more efficiently.In the coming years, a lot of Microsoft\\'s growth will rely on the growth of its cloud business. Azure trails Amazon Web Services (AWS) in market share, but the business is growing impressively. It gained market share in the past quarter and sits comfortably in second place, with a 24% share of the global cloud infrastructure services industry as of 2023\\'s fourth quarter. AWS and Google Cloud are at 31% and 11%, respectively.The emergence of AI and Microsoft\\'s partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI has helped boost the company\\'s competitive advantage in the space. Microsoft Azure had 53,000 AI customers at the end of its last quarter, and over a third were added within the past 12 months.As the cloud industry grows, Azure should continue to drive a lot of Microsoft\\'s growth. The increase in research and development spending shows the company is committed to innovation and staying with the times.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

       "  \"Choosing the right stocks for your portfolio takes time, patience, and effort. You need to understand and identify your investment goals as well as life goals. While the plans you have for retirement, for example, might change with time, you need to have an idea of why you're investing and what you want to invest in.You should understand the level of risk you're comfortable with and choose companies you know well and are willing to hold for at least five years in your portfolio. You should also make sure you're putting cash into quality businesses that have durable competitive advantages and compelling financials, or a path to stable financial growth.If you're looking for explosive growth stocks to buy now and hold for the long run, here are two companies to scoop up as 2024 begins.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is a name that needs no introduction, and while growth rates may not be what they were several years ago given the ongoing changes in discretionary consumer spending, this is a business that continues to pack a powerful punch in a wide range of market environments. Not only does the company control an incredible 25% share of the smartphone market -- more than any other competitor -- but it also just reported another quarter of record business milestones.As of Apple's fiscal 2024 first quarter, ended Dec. 30, 2023, it had more than 2.2 billion active devices installed for customers worldwide. That figure represented a new record for the business. Apple's net sales and profits in the first quarter were driven primarily by iPhone sales and a new sales milestone in the company's services segment.While Apple is known for its hardware devices -- the latest addition being its just-launched Vision Pro headset that runs for a cool $3,500 -- the company's subscription-based services division is slowly but surely accounting for more and more of its overall growth. That segment includes products like Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, app purchases from the iTunes store, and advertising revenue.In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Apple reported net sales of about $120 billion, up 2% from one year ago, and net income of $34 billion, a 13% year-over-year bump. Of that net sales total, $70 billion came from iPhone sales while $23 billion was attributable to its services segment. In other words, those two segments combined comprised more than three-quarters of Apple's net sales in the three-month period.Apple also reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.18, up 16% from one year ago and a new company record. Plus, the company has been an extremely reliable dividend payer through the years. Despite the stock having a yield of 1%, Apple has raised its payout by approximately 120% over the past decade.Apple's dominance of the smartphone market, its broad collection of other market-leading hardware products, and continued adoption of its asset-light subscription-based services are enabling robust performance on both the top and bottom lines. If you're looking for a stock to buy, hold, and keep adding to through the years, Apple seems like a no-brainer contender for your buy list.MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) may not be as familiar to some investors as companies like Amazon, Shopify, or Etsy. However, this e-commerce giant has an impressive lineup of businesses and the balance sheet to match. The company is the largest e-commerce entity and most visited online marketplace in Latin America. MercadoLibre's online platform habitually receives about half a billion visitors per month, and accounts for more than one-fifth of all retail sales that occur in region.The Latin American e-commerce market has historically been very underpenetrated, primarily due to varying degrees of technological connectivity throughout the region and troublesome logistics options. However, the region is quickly catching up to the advent of e-commerce.The total addressable market opportunity is booming as adoption of online retail explodes and cross-border sales rise from merchants in the region. For example, one Morgan Stanley study estimated that the Latin American e-commerce market would hit a valuation of $200 billion by 2025.MercadoLibre doesn't just operate the region's top e-commerce platform. Other businesses include a leading fintech platform with a variety of offerings including credit card and consumer loan products, its own logistics network, advertising services, and more. Mercado Pago, its payment processing platform, generates almost as payment volume offline as it does online.Years ago, MercadoLibre recognized that in a heavily cash-based society, plenty of merchants in brick-and-mortar stores needed a more optimized way to process payments for customers. The company launched mobile point-of-sale (POS) devices nearly a decade ago, and business has exploded since that time.In the most recent quarter, MercadoLibre reported gross merchandise volume of more than $11 billion, a 60% increase from the year prior. Net revenue for the three-month period totaled just shy of $4 billion, a 70% surge from one year ago. The company's credit portfolio increased 23% year over year to $3.4 billion.Meanwhile, online total payment volume totaled $47 billion, while offline total payment volume hit $35 billion. Those two figures represented year-over-year hikes of 121% and 145%, respectively. These numbers are phenomenal in any market environment, particularly one where economic conditions are strained globally.Importantly, MercadoLibre is gaining more and more control over the entire customer journey from purchase to delivery, with its logistics network handling 94.2% of deliveries in the third quarter of 2023. The shares are up 50% from a year ago, but it's not too late for investors who wish to benefit from its long-term potential.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

       "  'In this article, we discuss 10 best augmented reality stocks under $5. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the augmented reality industry, head directly to 5 Best Augmented Reality Stocks Under $5.Augmented reality technology is found in broad applications within entertainment, training, brand engagement, augmented surgeries, virtual tours, and quality control, among others. Small and medium-sized enterprises are increasingly adopting this technology to improve customer experiences and stay competitive in the market. Industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, retail, gaming, education, and automotive are actively embracing AR for training, maintenance, assistance, and monitoring purposes. The augmented reality market is expected to grow due to increased smartphone adoption and app integration, according to Fortune Business Insights. Moreover, key market players collaborating with 5G providers to address latency issues are anticipated to drive market growth. For example, in May 2022, Telstra Group Limited (ASX:TLS), an Australian telecommunications company, partnered with Google and Accenture to create a 5G-powered augmented reality experience at Melbourne’s Marvel Stadium. Such collaborations among major tech providers are likely to enhance the potential of AR in diverse innovative and immersive applications.The AR market was valued at $42.20 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach $1.11 trillion by 2030, exhibiting a 50.7% compound annual growth rate. In 2022, the North American augmented reality market was valued at $13.72 billion. Key industry players like PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) offer different AR solutions. For instance, PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC) provides products like Vuforia AR, Vuforia Studio, Vuforia Expert Capture, Vuforia Instruct, and Vuforia Spatial Toolbox, while Google LLC offers ARCore, an AR platform featuring cloud anchors, environmental HDR, and depth for digital objects.In 2023, we witnessed the launch of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro, alongside Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\\'s premium VR device, targeted either as a creative tool or a luxury item due to its high price. This year might unveil Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\\'s anticipated AR glasses. Different devices, like the Apple Glasses and Meta Quest Pro, will strive to offer unique experiences. Some will emphasize a sophisticated high-end encounter, while others will prioritize lightweight and simplicity, understanding that current headset sizes and weights deter adoption for many users. Online platforms enabling remote teamwork will evolve in 2024, aiming for increased immersion and practicality. Despite the popularity of remote work, certain aspects of in-person communication are challenging to replicate. Collaborative mixed reality tools are expected to utilize VR and AR more extensively, capturing and expressing the subtle nuances of interaction that are difficult to convey through video calls.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Tim Cook unveiled the \"Vision Pro,\" an augmented reality headset, during the WWDC event in June 2023. According to Cook, it represents a new kind of computer that enhances user experience through the most natural and intuitive methods. He likened its significance to the introduction of previous Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products, suggesting that just as the Mac brought personal computing and the iPhone brought mobile computing, the Vision Pro will introduce us to spatial computing. The Vision Pro marks Apple\\'s entry into a significant new product category, the first since 2015. Priced at $3,499, this headset seamlessly combines virtual and augmented reality. Historically, this market has been somewhat specialized, with Meta holding a dominant position. However, Apple aims to leverage advanced technology and its renowned marketing skills to elevate this sector. During the launch event at Apple\\'s New York store, CEO Tim Cook highlighted the device\\'s impressive interface, describing it as a \"magical way to control\" the headset. The Vision Pro utilizes eye movement and hand gestures for navigation, offering users immersive experiences. Cook draws parallels between the Vision Pro\\'s debut and the launches of other iconic Apple devices, such as the Mac, iPod, and iPhone, emphasizing that it now stands among the groundbreaking products in Apple\\'s history.New entrants are creating a buzz in the augmented reality space. For example, Xreal, a maker of augmented reality glasses, is in the process of raising $60 million in funding, bringing its total funding to over $300 million and valuing the company at more than $1 billion. The CEO, Chi Xu, aims to stay ahead of competitors like Apple, Meta Platforms, and Google in the augmented reality space. Xreal, a Chinese startup, holds approximately 4% of the overall mixed reality market, with a significant presence in the AR-only devices sector. The funds will support the production of 2 million devices next year, with a target of going public in the United States within the next two years. The company anticipates generating $100 million to $150 million in revenue in 2024 and between $200 million and $300 million in 2025.Although the augmented reality market is dominated by tech giants like Apple Inc.

       "  \"Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) new $0.50 per-share dividend isn't going to turn any heads among investors seeking big yields. What likely caught Wall Street's attention though was that the company amended its capital return program alongside its blowout fourth-quarter earnings release to add $50 billion to its share repurchase authorization.With the share price climbing as high as $485 the day after it reported earnings, the annual dividend yield amounts to a paltry 0.41%. That's not going to get most dividend investors very excited about buying shares in the big tech company.But dividend investors shouldn't overlook Meta's decision to initiate a dividend just because the yield is extremely low. In fact, the dividend may be one of the most important things to come out of Meta's earnings report for long-term investors.Meta has had a generous capital return program for several years. It started with a modest share repurchase authorization in 2017, but quickly ramped up the buybacks. Over the past three years, management has bought back $92.3 billion of its stock.The new share repurchase authorization adds another $50 billion in potential buybacks on top of the existing $31 billion under its pre-existing authorization. That's a lot of money, even for a company that's worth $1.2 trillion.While share repurchases are a great way for management to return capital to shareholders, there's no requirement for management to use even one penny of retained earnings to buy back stock. On the other hand, a dividend is a much stronger commitment. With the dividend, the board is saying it'll return cash to shareholders every quarter. It's starting with dividend payments amounting to about $5 billion annually.What's more, dividends are sticky. Most companies don't declare dividends for just a quarter or a year. They start paying a dividend with the intent of paying it for years to come. What's more, most expect to pay more cash to shareholders every year.That's a sign of confidence from management that it'll produce consistently strong and growing cash flow and earnings for years to come to support a dividend.Some investors won't buy a stock unless it pays a dividend. Now that Meta's joined the fray, even if it yields just 0.4%, it could attract the eyes of a whole new subset of investors.Importantly, the dividend could provide a floor for the stock, as long as investors can reasonably expect Meta to meet its commitment to the quarterly payments. If the stock price drops, the yield will increase to the point of becoming attractive to some dividend investors. With the strong prospects for dividend growth from Meta, it won't take a very high current yield for it to be an attractive dividend investment.What's more, Meta now qualifies for inclusion in a whole new set of index funds and ETFs. Those focusing on dividend growth, in particular, may soon find themselves owning a small piece of Meta.Meta's dividend strikes similarities to the two biggest companies in the world: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).All three are tech giants, which aren't historically big dividend payers. But both Microsoft and Apple have consistently increased their dividends while reinvesting plenty of money into the businesses to grow faster and faster every year.When Microsoft declared its first dividend in 2003, it paid shareholders an annual payment of $0.08 per share. That translated to a yield of about 0.3% at the time. Nonetheless, Microsoft's produced market-beating returns over the last 20 years while returning tons of cash to shareholders. It now pays $3 per year.Likewise, Apple reinitiated its dividend in 2012, paying shareholders $2.65 per quarter. That worked out to a fairly attractive yield of 1.8% at the time. But similar to Microsoft, Apple has been able to consistently raise its dividend every year while growing the business. As a result, shares have increased more than eightfold since it first declared its dividend, not to mention that the quarterly dividend payment has increased by 2.5 times.It may be tough to see how Meta grows its stock price as much as Apple or Microsoft have since they each initiated their dividends. After all, it's already a $1.2 trillion business. But for a little bit of perspective, Microsoft and Apple were already the largest publicly traded companies by market capitalization in the years they initiated their dividends.At the very least, investors can expect consistent capital returns from the dividend, which should support the stock price and provide confidence to investors that management sees a lot more cash flow and earnings in the future.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

       "  'Any Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock forecast has to recognize how critical the iPhone has been, but, as the company’s management team has proven, the company is far more than that. From its cloud business to its services and accessories (among other hardware devices), Apple is an absolute behemoth in the consumer discretionary sector.Fluctuating between the world’s largest and second-largest company regularly, Apple keeps its power in the markets and remains a core portfolio holding of many passive investors (whether or not they know it). In fact, the market weighting for Apple remains at or near a market-leading level, for good reason. Let’s dive into why the company should be considered a core holding by active and passive investors alike.After Apple’s recent earnings report, 43 analysts projected the company’s 2024 revenue to come in at $388.3 billion, similar to the previous 12 months. Predicted earnings per share stood at $6.55, also consistent with last year’s results.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese were down from previous estimates, but the market has remained steadfast with its view that cash flow growth should remain robust at this mega-cap giant. For many, that’s enough of a reason to own this company at over 30-times earnings.Analysts reaffirmed Apple’s consensus price target at $200, indicating they don’t expect lower revenue forecasts to affect its market worth. Now varied estimates resulted in this consensus estimate. These analyst price targets range from a bullish $250 to a bearish $125 per share, showcasing diverse perspectives on Apple’s future.Aside from its gadgets, Apple also has a very strong services segment. The segment boasts $23.1 billion in revenue, and it has been helping drive the company’s to success. Because of its innovation, the stock surged about 23% in 2023 and is expecting to grow more in 2024.Wedbush analysts hailed Apple’s Vision Pro as a potential “game changer” post its store debut. They noted its early mass appeal and strong initial reception, surpassing expectations and foreseeing future integration with AI.Apple’s Vision Pro entered the competition against Meta’s Quest 3, the leading AR headset in 2023. Despite its higher price starting at $3,499 compared to Quest 3’s $500, analysts viewed it as a valuable asset for Apple.Bank of America estimated it could contribute 68-89 cents per share to Apple’s EPS over five years. They also foresee a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by generative AI.In the recent earnings call CEO Tim Cook also highlighted some adjustments to Apple’s iOS, Safari, Apple Pay, and App Store that aligns with EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).He emphasized Apple’s commitment to privacy, security, and usability, despite potential limitations due to regulatory compliance. Apple’s CFO Luca Maestri clarified these changes would affect only EU users, constituting approximately 7% of the global App Store revenue.In the fourth quarter, Cook highlighted robust growth in emerging markets, including record-breaking sales in Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, and strong performance in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile.Despite declining sales in China, where\\xa0Apple remains strong, this company is a top global smartphone seller, and will likely continue to be for years to come.Apple is a company that is really unparalleled in the world of financial markets right now. The company’s recent product innovations, its pursuit of more ecosystem-driven services revenue, and its rock-solid balance sheet make this stock one to hold for the long-term.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\\xa0Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

       "  \"Warren Buffett is known for seriously looking at the price tag when he buys a stock. The chairman of Berkshire Hathaway goes for players that are undervalued and holds onto them for the long term. Back in the first quarter of 2016, he added a top technology and consumer goods company to the portfolio -- and that stock has gone on to advance more than 600%.I'm talking about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). If you haven't yet bought shares of the company, you might wonder if you missed out on an opportunity. But what if I told you that, considering the company's long-term potential, the shares still look cheap? That means this Warren Buffett stock holds plenty of potential to make you richer over time.Apple, the company, may be just about as well known as the piece of fruit. The company sells the iconic iPhone and Mac, along with other devices that have become popular worldwide. These products have not only helped Apple increase earnings over time, but also helped with other key financial measures like free cash flow and return on invested capital.In the most recent quarter, Apple's earnings per share rose 16% to an all-time high of $2.18, and the company said services revenue also reached a record. It's no surprise services are booming because Apple's number of installed devices has increased to more than 2.2 billion -- its highest level ever. The more active devices out there, the more of an opportunity Apple has to sell services to users -- from cloud storage to digital content.Apple faces certain challenges such as tougher competition in China from local rival Huawei and pressure from foreign exchange rates. Even the fact that Apple has been slower to offer details about its artificial intelligence (AI) plans than other tech players could weigh on the stock.But overall, Apple has offered investors the perfect combination of growth and security, thanks to the earnings I've just described and the company's dividend payment. This isn't necessarily a given in the world of technology stocks.Here's why all of this could continue and Apple stock should climb even higher over time. First, Apple's solid moat, or competitive advantage, is the company's brand strength, and this may keep it at the head of the pack. Apple users generally love the products so much they stick with them. In the quarter, Apple said the number of iPhone users upgrading reached an all-time high.In addition to this, Apple continues to win over new users. For example, in the quarter, almost two-thirds of Apple Watch buyers were new to that product. And about half of iPad and Mac buyers were new to those products.Finally, Apple's work over the years to build up its number of device users now can bring in a whole new source of revenue -- from the services sold to them. As mentioned above, this revenue hit a record in the quarter, and that's after doing the same in previous quarters.Services revenue clearly is on the rise. This is fantastic news because it means the purchase of an Apple device doesn't stop there. Instead, it translates into recurrent revenue for the company.Now let's consider Apple's share price. The stock has climbed more than 20% over the past year, but despite the gains, the valuation remains reasonable. It trades for about 29x trailing-12-month earnings, more than double its valuation by that measure when Buffett first got in on the stock. But it's important to remember that revenue has climbed considerably since that time -- and as mentioned above, a record number of devices now are driving significant growth in services revenue.The Apple of today isn't identical to the Apple of 2016. Today, growth prospects are even brighter, and that means the stock continues to look like a bargain for the long-term investor. That's why this Warren Buffett favorite could help make you richer over time, even if you're just buying the stock right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

       "  \"Despite Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla delivering some of the best gains in stock market history since they each came public, they aren't the best performing names in the S&P 500 index over the last 10 years. In fact, none of them even crack the top 10.However, the time frame does play a very important role when making these comparisons. For example, Apple is the best-performing S&P 500 stock over the last 20 years, and as analyst Charlie Bilello points out, the group of stocks leading the market does change quite dramatically depending on the time scale:The best performing stocks in the S&P 500 over the last 5, 10, 15, and 20 years... pic.twitter.com/CQw9MQlPN1-- Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) February 4, 2024As you can see, the last 10 years have been dominated by semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which occupy the top three spots. Here's why.Broadcom was originally founded in 1991, and it's responsible for a number of computing and electronics innovations like the optical mouse sensor as well as infrared transceivers, which facilitated wireless data exchange between printers, phones, cash registers, and more. But the company was transformed in 2016 when it merged with semiconductor giant Avago Technologies, and it's now a conglomerate with a presence in several segments of the tech industry.Beyond the merger with Avago, Broadcom acquired semiconductor device supplier CA Technologies for $18.9 billion in 2018, cybersecurity giant Symantec for $10.7 billion in 2019, and cloud computing software powerhouse VMware for a whopping $69 billion in 2023.VMware is perhaps Broadcom's most significant deal ever, and not just because of the gigantic price tag. The company develops cloud software to help enterprises maximize their computing infrastructure, which is critical right now because technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) require substantial amounts of computing power.For example, one user with one server might only utilize 10% of its capacity, but VMware's virtual machines allow multiple users to plug into that same infrastructure to harness as much of it as possible, minimizing waste. It adds another pillar to Broadcom's growing portfolio of AI-adjacent products and services.Broadcom delivered a record $35.8 billion in revenue during 2023 (ended Dec. 31). VMware's revenue will be lumped together with the rest of the conglomerate starting in 2024, and that will help increase the company's revenue base by an impressive 40% this year, taking it to $50 billion (according to management's guidance).Broadcom might just hold onto its position as one of the best-performing stocks.Advanced Micro Devices designs some of the most popular central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) chips for personal computing and gaming purposes. AMD's hardware powers both of the world's most successful gaming consoles, the Sony PlayStation 5 and the Microsoft Xbox Series X. AMD chips can also be found in the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles.But the more recent gains in AMD stock have been driven by its data center business, which is home to the new MI300 series of chips designed to handle AI workloads. The MI300 comes as a pure GPU (MI300X), but also in a CPU-plus-GPU configuration (MI300A) to create the world's first accelerated processing unit (APU) for data centers. The MI300 series is AMD's answer to Nvidia's industry-leading H100 AI chip and the upcoming H200.Data center operators Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms have become MI300 customers already. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his company might also be using the chips soon. In an earnings call with investors for the recent fourth quarter of 2023, AMD dramatically increased its forecast for data center GPU sales thanks to the MI300's growing customer pool. The company originally estimated sales would reach $2 billion during 2024, but that forecast now stands at $3.5 billion.But it gets better. During the quarter, AMD revealed it had an estimated 90% share in the market for AI chips for personal computers. Millions of computers have shipped with the new Ryzen 7000 series (also known as Ryzen AI) CPUs. They allow AI workloads to be processed on-device, making the user experience much faster because they don't have to outsource computing power to external data centers.Ryzen AI chips drove a whopping 62% year-over-year increase in AMD's client segment revenue during Q4, and the company is preparing to release next-generation variants that could be 3 times faster than their predecessors.The combination of AMD's growing presence in the AI data center space and its dominant position in personal computing could make 2024 its best year ever, which should drive even further gains in its stock price.The title of best-performing stock of the last 10 years goes to Nvidia. It delivered a seismic gain of 17,900%, which means an investment of just $1,000 a decade ago would be worth $179,000 today. As I mentioned earlier, the company's H100 GPU is the world's leading AI data center chip, and demand is so hot that Nvidia simply can't produce them fast enough.Nonetheless, in the recent fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), the company's data center revenue still more than tripled to a record-high $14.5 billion. Management expects to deliver another record-breaking quarter when it reports its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results later this month, for the three months ended Jan. 31.Investors' focus is now on Nvidia's new H200 chip, which is due for release midyear. When it comes to inferencing -- feeding live data to an AI model so it can make real predictions -- the H200 delivers up to twice the performance of its predecessor. It also consumes half the amount of energy, making it far cheaper for data center operators to run.If Nvidia's forecast for the fiscal 2024 full year proves accurate, its $58.8 billion in revenue would represent an incredible 1,323% growth over the last decade. Therefore, the substantial gain in its stock price is certainly backed up by its financial results.The law of large numbers will prevent Nvidia from maintaining such astronomical growth rates forever, but Wall Street analysts still expect the company's revenue and earnings per share to grow by 58% and 69%, respectively, in the upcoming fiscal 2025 full year (which will run from Feb. 1, 2024 until Jan. 31, 2025).Plus, depending which Wall Street forecast you rely upon, AI could add anywhere from $7 trillion to $200 trillion to the global economy over the next decade. Nvidia might be facing increased competition from the likes of AMD, but its data center chips are still the gold standard for now, so more upside could be on the way for its stock price in the coming years.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

       "  \"The stock market has produced considerable returns for many investors over the years, and it's never too early or too late to plan for a better financial future. The types of stocks you buy and even your risk tolerance may change throughout your investing journey, but it's always a good time to hold quality businesses that are poised to deliver long-term meaningful growth.Whether you're a new or experienced investor, you don't want to overlook the following two names as you construct your basket of winning stocks.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has delivered a total return of roughly 350% over the trailing five years, thanks to its continued dividend increases and solid share-price performance. To give you an idea of just how fantastic that number is, the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of 100% in that same time frame.Economic headwinds come and go. While there's no denying that shifts in consumer spending are impacting most growth-oriented businesses -- and tech giants are no exception -- Apple continues to maintain a significant moat. Its smartphone business is the leading driver of this moat and continued growth. This is despite recent weakness in sales of some other hardware products, as well as a slowdown in sales in its third-largest market, China, due to increased competition in the region.Smartphone sales accounted for $70 billion of Apple's total net sales of $120 billion in the first quarter of its fiscal 2024, which the company reported on Feb. 1. The other major needle-mover for Apple right now is its services segment, which revolves around its collection of subscription-based offerings. Services net sales totaled $23 billion for the quarter, a noteworthy 11% bump from one year ago.Apple doesn't individually report advertising sales -- they're included in its overall services segment. However, the company's advertising potential across its family of apps and through the App Store is a still heavily untapped secret weapon. According to a study by Statista, advertising sales could bring in over $6 billion in revenue for the company in 2024 alone, which is still a fraction of its overall revenue but far from insignificant.The growing balance between the asset-heavy and asset-light components of Apple's business and the fact that subscription-related sales are growing at such a rapid clip is noteworthy. Services segment sales were about three times higher than either Mac or iPad sales in the recent quarter. While consumers may be more hesitant to shell out hundreds or thousands of dollars to purchase a brand-new iPad or Mac right now, paying an additional subscription fee for music, news, or streaming entertainment is a more palatable expense.Apple may be one of the most well-known names in tech, and its history of innovation and continued expansion in all market environments has made it a mainstay for many investors. The company is also well-positioned for near-term bumps in the road with $173 billion in cash and investments on hand. This stock looks like a worthy addition to any well-diversified portfolio in 2024 and beyond.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has had to contend with a difficult environment in the last few years, but its focus on operational efficiency and profitability is paying off. The full-year 2023 was fantastic for the business on multiple fronts. It saw robust earnings and cash flow, as well as favorable growth across its core businesses.In 2023, net sales jumped 12% year over year to $575 billion, while net income reversed from a net loss of $2.7 billion in 2022 to a whopping gain of $30 billion of net income. Looking back beyond year-over-year comparisons, Amazon's net sales and net income in 2023 represented respective growth rates of 105% and 150% from 2019.Right now, the company's cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the most notable driver of profitability. Of Amazon's total operating income of $37 billion in 2023, $25 billion was derived from AWS. Trailing-12-month operating cash flow rose 82% to $85 billion, while free cash flow for that period hit $37 billion.Concerns about discretionary consumer spending remain front and center. Amazon reported that customers purchased over 1 billion products on its e-commerce platform from its deal-driven Black Friday and Cyber Monday events. Millions of new customers added Prime memberships to their accounts in 2023. And customers bought more goods on Amazon in the 2023 holiday season than any previous year on record.Online-store sales contributed $232 billion to Amazon's net sales total for full-year 2023, while fees derived from third-party seller services added $140 billion to the top line. E-commerce is still the largest driver of top-line growth for Amazon, followed by AWS, advertising services, and subscription-based services.Amazon is incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into many of its properties, from improving product listings on its flagship e-commerce platform to driving better advertising decisions to its AWS offerings. For example, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. signed a multiyear agreement with AWS, part of which will involve deploying generative AI application builder Amazon Bedrock across over 100 new-use cases for its financial services business. Similarly, biopharmaceutical giant Amgen plans to build upon its existing partnership with the company and use Amazon SageMaker, a cloud-based machine-learning platform, to streamline the drug development process.There's a lot to like about Amazon's flagship and newer streams of business growth. Investors might find that it's an opportune time to capitalize on that long-term potential before shares move higher.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

       "  'The European Union is making life a lot more challenging for businesses across the globe.The 27-nation bloc has aggressively adopted new laws meant to police personal data, social media content, and the dominance of Big Tech. It has sued to block mergers. And it has readied the world’s first comprehensive legislation to police artificial intelligence.The actions are raising the stakes for how companies operate both inside and outside the EU. Just last month, EU opposition to a union of two American tech companies — Amazon (AMZN) and robot vacuum maker iRobot (IRBT) — was enough for the firms to call off their $1.4 billion merger.Resistance from the EU was also enough to persuade Silicon Valley-based Photoshop maker Adobe (ADBE) to give up on plans to acquire San Francisco-based web-based design platform Figma and motivate US biotech giant Illumina to sell off a cancer-screening company called Grail.Big companies in the US and across the globe now face a critical decision: Do they adjust the way they make products and provide services to the EU’s more aggressive laws or bet that more lenient regulations will take hold in other countries where they operate?Some giant companies that operate globally aren’t willing to take the chance of tiptoeing around the EU, which remains the world’s third-largest economy and is home to roughly 450 million people.\"We\\'ve seen businesses say, ‘I\\'m going to build my products, my widgets, my service, to align with the most restrictive guidelines and not have different jurisdictional approaches,\\'\" said Jordan Fischer, a lecturer on cross-border information governance at the University of California Berkeley and partner at Constangy.This pressure to adopt the EU’s version of business compliance even outside its jurisdiction is growing, though isn\\'t new. It\\'s known as \"the Brussels effect,\" a term coined in 2012 by Columbia Law School professor Anu Bradford to describe how the EU\\'s aggressive legislation exerts “unprecedented and deeply underestimated global power.\"Brussels, in Belgium, is considered the unofficial capital of the EU.\"Companies with customers, or hopes of future business, in the EU decide to comply with the regulations in order to be able to continue selling into the EU, and interacting with potential EU consumers,\" said Meredith Kolsky Lewis, director of cross-border legal studies at University at Buffalo School of Law.The EU, which was created in 1993, has a long history of moving more aggressively in its regulation of businesses than the US.It even chalked up some early victories. In 2001, its antitrust stance doomed a $42 billion proposed merger between GE and Honeywell, even though that industrial union had received approval in the US. In 2007, it adopted broad environmental legislation that pushed chemical companies around the globe to adhere to new restrictions.In more recent years, the EU’s attempt to rein in tech giants has become a core focus. The EU\\'s first major tech legislation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), went into effect in 2018.It is designed to protect consumer privacy and security and imposes obligations on companies anywhere in the world as long as they \"target or collect data related to people in the EU.\"The EU then added two more laws in subsequent years — the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act— that attempt to curb the dominance of Big Tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), and the content of major online social media and e-commerce sites.\"Where regulation like the GDPR has the biggest effect — it\\'s actually outside of Europe, in countries in the developing world,\" said Charles Kenny, an economist and senior fellow at the Washington think tank Center for Global Development.\"And I think that\\'s sad. I think it\\'s something that European rule makers and regulators tend not to take into account.\"In response to tech regulations that include GDPR, which Kenny said made no exceptions for startups, a group of African Union nations formed an alliance to advocate for rules more friendly to entrepreneurs in poor nations like Sierra Leone and Ghana.\"It\\'s not a big problem for the Googles of the world or the Facebooks of the world to comply. It is a big problem for small tech startups,\" Kenny said, adding that he agrees that certain levels of regulation are needed.\"I worry the same might happen with these AI regulations.\"The EU does intend to apply new legal restraints around artificial intelligence this year after EU members last week signaled their agreement on the world’s first comprehensive legislation to regulate AI.The new rules will focus on the uses of AI technology and classify how heavily they are regulated depending on how risky the application is, with facial recognition and certain medical innovations requiring approval before being made available to customers.Federal laws specific to AI don’t exist yet in the US, and it’s unknown whether that will happen.The combination of the added tech regulations from the EU and confusion within the US as to its own intentions means more uncertainty and further complexity for global businesses, Lewis said.Despite the hard line that the EU has taken with its tech laws, Fischer said there is reason for companies to hope that the EU and the US will come into greater alignment. She pointed to a framework concluded with the US this year known as the Trade and Technology Council.\"I think that makes a lot of companies breathe a little bit easier. Not easy. But easier,\" Fischer said.Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

In Hong Kong’s bustling Mong Kok, an electronics importer specializing in getting gadgets early asks for HK$35,800 ($4,580), with the price shifting on a daily basis. His advice: best to wait.Cupertino, California-based Apple put the Vision Pro on sale in a limited number of stores in the US at the start of this month, with an elaborate setup and customization process for each buyer. The company wants to ensure an optimal first experience with its virtual reality goggles — which it dubs a spatial computer, owing to the hand gestures used to control it.Questions remain about how big the consumer market is for so-called extended reality (XR) devices, and especially ones with a price like the Vision Pro’s. But the gadget’s early exclusivity is pushing prices up.“Our observations indicate inflated prices on unofficial channels, reaching up to 40,000 yuan for Vision Pro units,” Counterpoint Research analyst Ivan Lam said. “However, these purchases likely represent a limited supply, originating from outside markets and deviating from typical consumer behavior.”The drive to acquire an early unit of the new device comes from various sources, IDC analyst Bryan Ma said. Beyond dedicated Apple fans, overseas software developers as well as industry players and rivals will want to get hands-on experience quickly to figure out their next steps, according to Ma.Apple’s main rival in the space is Meta Platforms Inc., the leader in VR with its Quest goggles. While the Quest is not in the same price class as the Vision Pro, there is an incumbent there: Finland’s Varjo Technologies Oy. Set up by former Nokia engineers, Varjo has a long list of enterprise customers for its XR glasses, which cost upward of $3,990 and are used for tasks like pilot training and industrial design visualiation.--With assistance from Gao Yuan and Takashi Mochizuki.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAdobe’s Very Cautious Gambit to Inject AI Into EverythingWhat’s Really Behind Tesla’s SlowdownCan I Hire My Crush?The US Will Face Blowback in the Middle East, No Matter WhatIt’s Time to Talk About Those Taylor Swift Super Bowl Bets©2024 Bloomberg L.P.'],\n",

       "  \"Shares of Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS) jumped as much as 18.6% higher on Wednesday, cooling down to a robust 14.6% gain at the end of the day. The designer of audio control and voice-processing chips reported fantastic third-quarter results that exceeded analyst expectations by a country mile.Your average Wall Street firm would have settled for earnings of roughly $2.01 per share with revenues near $540 million. Instead, Cirrus saw sales increase 5% year over year to $620 million. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings rose by 20% to $2.89 per diluted share.Cirrus is expanding its market reach outside the smartphone market where the company has provided the audio processors in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhones for years. Important product wins and initial shipments for Cirrus chips in Q3 included high-end laptops and tablets, with an eye toward virtual reality (VR) headsets and other wearable computing devices in the future. For example, Cirrus chips provide the audio experience in the recently released Apple Vision Pro VR headset.Though Cirrus is seeking new clients outside of Apple, the pride of Cupertino still accounts for an overwhelming majority of this company's orders. Apple stood for 89% of Cirrus' total sales in this report, up from 83% three years ago.At the same time, Cirrus has diversified its product catalog to an impressive degree. In the long run, the company aims for a 50/50 balance between audio-chip sales and revenues from other mixed-signal processors. Examples include digital-camera controllers, fast-charging solutions, and tactile-feedback chips.After Wednesday's big jump, Cirrus stock returns to prices not seen since last April. I'm interested in the company's diversification efforts, and the stock looks quite affordable today at 2.7 times trailing sales and 14 times earnings. Until the client hunt gains traction, you can consider Cirrus Logic's stock a more affordable proxy for buying Apple stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Cirrus Logic right now?Before you buy stock in Cirrus Logic, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cirrus Logic wasn’t one of them.

       "  '2024 is beginning the same way 2023 ended: with the Magnificent 7 stocks performing exceptionally well. Prognosticators expect that at least six of the seven firms included in the group will be the top contributors to fourth-quarter earnings of the S&P 500 Index. Let’s take a look at some of the top Magnificent 7 predictions to be well aware of. In addition, these stocks are expected to be very strong in 2024 but where will they be in five years?Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are currently expected to grow to a price of around $230 in 2024. That same price forecast suggests that Apple shares will trade for $445 in 2029. For shares to double that would imply an 18% annual yield over those four years based on the Rule of 72.\\xa0 Given that Apple has grown by 19% each year on average since it became publicly available, it’s possible.The company is very clearly going through issues, especially as they relate to iPhone sales in major markets, namely China. Yet Apple has so many opportunities at the same time. There’s little reason to discount it given its history.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comE-commerce and cloud giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) saw its stock gain 81% last year. The company dominates online shopping and the burgeoning world of cloud computing. However, it also faces significant competition in both of those areas. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) continues to grow its online shopping presence and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) continue to threaten its cloud dominance.At the same time, that’s the same narrative that has followed the company for several years. 2023’s exceptional performance showed that Amazon is not giving up ground easily, if at all. So it should come as no surprise that analysts continue to rate the company exceptionally highly. Of the 59 analysts covering Amazon, 98% rate it a buy.Amazon’s AWS Cloud division is expected to grow by more than 13% in the fourth quarter. The company is deep in a pitched battle against Microsoft for generative AI cloud dollars.In addition, Amazon’s AI opportunity is going to continue to dominate headlines surrounding its growth. Currently, many analysts believe Microsoft has the edge in that realm. The consensus is that Amazon stock will increase by approximately 250% in value by 2029. Short of a massive government intervention and a breakup it’s difficult to see why Amazon won’t continue to provide massive returns.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAlphabet rebounded well last year. However, it’s again facing issues after posting earnings that failed to meet expectations. Advertising sales increased by 11% in the fourth quarter, reaching $65.5 billion. Overall, sales grew by 13% during the time frame, reaching $86.3 billion.The company’s ad revenues –\\xa0 although lower than hoped for –\\xa0 are still growing. The pandemic was especially difficult on the company and rate cuts to combat a long period of quantitative easing made it worse. Alphabet also suffers from the perception that it is behind other Silicon Valley firms in AI.Analysts currently expect the stock to trade above $300 by 2029. That implies a return above 100% for those who invest today. Those figures are relatively muted compared to other Silicon Valley firms precisely because analysts currently view Alphabet’s AI efforts as lackluster. A lot can happen over the next few years. Alphabet has vast resources that could flip that narrative on its ear.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is expected to grow by approximately 15% in 2024. By 2029, it could be approaching $900 per share.Like Alphabet, Meta Platforms is primarily an ad company. It is also continuing its expansion into other growth areas, namely the metaverse. The company’s 2021 rebrand to take advantage of the Metaverse was seen as a flop but the tides are quickly changing.The reason is simple: Apple’s launch of its Vision Pro headset has set the stage for a headset war between the two Silicon Valley firms. Meta Platforms has invested $50 billion in its build out and vision for the metaverse. Products are now being commercialized and that will make measurement of the return on those investments much easier. The rubber is hitting the road in other words.Realistically speaking, the only thing that will slow meta platforms down in 2024 is a wider economic collapse. A soft landing is the much more likely outcome and that sets the stage for strong growth over the next few years.Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) propelled itself from an all-around slam dunk stock investment to something even bigger in 2023. Its early investment in OpenAI is likely to be one of the best strategic moves of the artificial intelligence era.It has propelled the company from one that dominated cloud and office software as just a few of its strategic strengths to something even bigger. Bullish forecasts suggest that its stock could grow by 50% in 2024 alone. A $1,000 per share price seems to be the overriding expectation by 2029.OpenAI is clearly looking to develop chips of its own.\\xa0 Sam Altman and his management team recently took meetings with leading Hardware firms in Asia to strengthen potential alliances. Altman and his team met with Samsung and SK Hynix in Seoul recently. The potential Alliance would combine ChatGPT’s software strengths with the two Korean firms’ strengths in high bandwidth memory hardware.OpenAI Is also collaborating with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) regarding similar development of chips. Thus, it’s logical to assume that growth could be even stronger over the next coming years.Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has clearly won the biggest battles in the early stages of the artificial intelligence war. No other company has managed to monetize AI like Nvidia. As a consequence, its stock has exploded over the past year. That is not expected to stop: In 2024 it is expected that NVDA shares could rise to $1,100.The prognosticators expect that share prices will rise to $1,900 by 2029. In addition, CEO Jensen Huang is optimistic about 2024 and why shouldn’t he be? The company continues to benefit from massive demand dynamics.Just about every firm with any connection to AI continues to scramble to secure Nvidia’s chips. Huang notes that the issue is really with its suppliers. The company continues to struggle to serve the massive demand for its AI chips with bottlenecks throughout its supply chain.Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.comThe current consensus view for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock isn’t very good, at least\\xa0 not in relation to the other Magnificent 7. It doesn’t offer that much growth per the consensus view at present.CEO Elon Musk is either a genius or a troubled Visionary depending on the day. When things go well, the business world loves him and his eccentricities. When they don’t, you start to hear about ideas like the Reality Distortion Field (RDF) and its negative effects. RDF is simply another way of stating that an individual has a magnetic charisma that can make people believe in things that are seemingly impossible.Tesla could see a massive upside between now and 2029 based on target prices five years from now. A tripling in price seems to be impossible. If Tesla’s current issues are simply the product of the normal adoption curve then those prices start to make much more sense.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

       "  'Stocks such as Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) have been among the worst performers. And while investors should steer clear of those stinkers, there are a few blue-chip names worth buying on the dip. Here are seven Dow stocks to buy on the dip: February 2024. Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comIn the lead-up to its recent fourth-quarter earnings, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell from a 52-week high. Its market cap dropped below $3 trillion. And it lost the title of the world’s most valuable publicly traded company to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Unfortunately, Apple slipped even more after the Q4 results showed a 13% decline in iPhone sales across China. The good news is much of the hand-wringing is overdone, and there are still good reasons to buy Apple shares.While it is true that sales of Apple’s electronic devices such as its iPhone, iPad, and MacBook computer have slowed, the services side of the company has more than made up for any shortfall. In addition, Apple still beat Wall Street’s expectations on the top and bottom lines with its Q4 print. Revenue rose in the quarter, breaking a streak of four consecutive quarters of declines.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple is one of the top Dow stocks to buy before it resumes its growth trajectory.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockAnother one of the top Dow stocks to buy on dips is McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). After the quick-service restaurant chain reported mixed financial results, the stock slipped. However, McDonald’s fourth-quarter results were strong. For example, MCD reported fourth-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $2.95, which topped Wall Street estimates of $2.82. Sales increased 8% year over year, with total revenue coming in at $6.41 billion, which was a little less than the $6.45 billion forecast by analysts.McDonald’s blamed the revenue miss on the escalating conflict in the Middle East, which has hurt its global sales. Outside the Middle East, all other global markets, including China, reported positive same-store sales growth. Domestic same-store sales at McDonald’s rose 4.3%, in line with Wall Street forecasts. MCD stock is down 4% on the year and ripe for the picking.Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.comNext up on this list of top Dow stocks to buy is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While the tech giant’s results managed to beat expectations on Wall Street, they didn’t blow away estimates. Plus, there was very little mention of artificial intelligence (AI) to be found in its report. This appears to have left investors feeling underwhelmed, which led to a pullback in the MSFT stock. However, investors should buy the dip.While Microsoft is only now starting to monetize AI, the company continues to demonstrate strong growth in its cloud-computing unit, with revenue from its Intelligent Cloud segment rising 20% from a year earlier to $25.88 billion. During Q4 2023, Microsoft closed its $68 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company has also announced custom cloud microchips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot AI add-on with its software bundles.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comU.S. oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has seen its stock fall 10% over the last 12 months as earnings have been eroded by a decline in crude prices. After posting record profits in 2022 when crude oil was trading above $100 a barrel, Chevron has had to contend with a steady decline over the last year. However, there are still reasons to buy CVX stock. These include a dividend payment that the company just increased by 8%, taking the yield on the stock to 4.28%.Chevron now pays out a strong quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share. Despite its profit in 2023 declining by 40%, the company still returned a record $23.60 billion to shareholders by paying out $11.30 billion in dividends and buying back $14.90 billion of its own stock. And although crude oil is currently trading around $73.50 per barrel, Chevron still managed to produce a record 3.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day last year as the company boosted its capital expenditures.Source: Daryl L / Shutterstock.comWhile it hasn’t been immune to the bank stock downturn, shares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) have fared better than most of its peers. Over the past year, JPM stock has gained 23%, including a 2% increase so far in 2024. The world’s biggest lender with $4 trillion of assets under management has proven to be more immune to high-interest rates than smaller banks.While JPMorgan reported mixed Q4 2023 financial results, the print was due to a $3 billion fee it was forced to pay related to the government’s seizure of failed regional lenders. However, despite the fee it paid to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, JPMorgan is still viewed as having come out of last year’s regional banking crisis as a winner. It acquired First Republic, a midsized lender to wealthy families, amid the collapse of several regional lenders across the U.S. First Republic is already having a positive impact on JPMorgan Chase’s earnings, according to the bank.Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.comSneaker giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) has been one of the worst-performing Dow components over the last few years. Over the last year, for example, the stock plummeted about 20%. Not helping, its share price plunged 12% in a single day in December after its sales guidance for 2024 was lowered. The good news is that Nike’s stock looks to have bottomed right around $100 per share. Each time the share price dips below that level, it quickly regains its footing.Patient investors who take a position in NKE stock now are likely to be rewarded with future gains coming off the current bottom. And while Nike’s most recent earnings print was mixed, it contained some encouraging data. For example, the company’s gross margin rose for the first time in 18 months and reached 44.6%; inventories declined 14%; and sales in China, an important market for the company, rose 10.1%, which was the fastest pace of growth since May 2023.It will likely take time to recover, but Nike is a Dow stock to buy on the dip.Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comWhile Visa (NYSE:V) has been volatile, investors might want to buy one of the dips. After all, the company just reported Q4 2023 financial results that beat analysts’ forecasts across the board. It also issued upbeat guidance as consumer spending remains resilient in the face of inflation and high-interest rates. It also posted EPS of $2.41, which topped Wall Street estimates of $2.34.Revenue in Q4 2023 totaled $8.60 billion, up 9% from a year earlier and ahead of forecasts that called for $8.50 billion in sales.Looking ahead, Visa said that it expects revenue growth in the current first quarter of 2024 in the “upper-mid to high-single digits” and profit growth in the “high-teens.” Visa said its payment volumes, which cover the year-end holiday shopping season, rose 8% in Q4 2023, while cross-border volumes increased 16%. The company’s total transactions in Q4 rose nearly 10% to $57.50 billion.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole\\xa0held long positions in AAPL and MSFT.

These companies will come into their own as the industry moves forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of those chip stocks to buy, as it reported earnings after Intel, to help convince investors that the market was not all doom and gloom. Although its Q1 guidance was nothing earth-shattering and fell short of expectations in some respects, where it counted the chipmaker was on point.AMD expects $3.5 billion in data center revenue in 2024, a 75% increase from its previous outlook of over $2 billion. In the December quarter, the chipmaker’s data center revenue jumped 38% from last year but was 43% higher than the prior quarter. It secured record revenue in CPU and data center GPU, which even exceeded management’s expectations. That was driven higher by the release of its new AI chip, the MI300X GPU, which is seeing quick uptake by customers.Advanced Micro Devices is naturally second to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has dominated the market. However, Advanced Micro Devices’ new chip could steal a chunk of business away from Nvidia. It’s reportedly faster and more efficient than its rival’s H100 chip and was expected to be sold at a discount as well.Investors should expect AMD’s data center business to continue rising at a smart clip in the years to come. There will be periods when there’s a lull. Any weakness in the stock price is an opportunity to buy.Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.comMobile chip stock Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is the next chip stock investors should be buying despite Intel’s weakness. It has a massive 80% share of the Ethernet switch market and is the major supplier for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) smartphone chips. The tech giant recently signed a multiyear, multibillion-dollar agreement for Broadcom’s 5G radio frequency components for Apple products. Apple represents 20% of the chipmaker’s revenue.The big driver now and for the foreseeable future will be AI chips. Broadcom said generative AI represented close to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter or 20% of total semiconductor revenue. Its AI accelerators from hyperscalers should drive networking revenue 30% higher in 2024. Now that it has completed its VMWare acquisition, software will be a future accelerator of its own.Broadcom’s excellent operating margins help it generate significant cash flows. Last year it generated $17.6 billion in free cash flow. VMWare has it forecasting even greater cash flow growth going forward. That led the chipmaker to hike its dividend 14% to $5.25 per share. The payout yields 1.7% annually.With AI spending rising and possibly growing exponentially, look for Broadcom to reap a large share of that money.Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.comExpect Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to continue its leading performance amongst Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android phones. While even management expected segment sales to be soft, demand for Android phones in China showed surprising strength. It suggests a recovery is underway. That bodes well for long-term growth for the chipmaker as revenue for the business was up 23% year-over-year. It also improved 16% sequentially.Apple and Samsung each account for more than 10% of Qualcomm’s revenue. Analysts thought the iPhone upgrade cycle was over but it appears it’s on the next leg higher. Apple just had a record fourth quarter for sales in China where the iPhone gained market share, as well as record sales in India. There is robust growth elsewhere around the world too.Although Samsung lost the crown of the world’s biggest phone seller to Apple, it bodes well for Qualcomm no matter who is on top. Because it owns the essential patents used in mobile handsets it should continue enjoying a steady stream of royalty income. Qualcomm is another chip stock to buy for long term wealth creation.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

       "  'Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.If you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.Microsoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call.Intel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.\"I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,\" he later added in response to an analyst\\'s question.We’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.While AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.Apple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company’s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn’t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it’ll prove both of this earnings season’s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

       "  'Apple\\xa0has been one of the market\\'s greatest growth stocks. Its shares soared 46,650% over the past two decades as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad revolutionized the digital music, smartphone, and tablet computing markets, respectively. Apple continued growing after Steve Jobs\\' death in 2011, and it expanded its ecosystem of subscription-based services while rolling out fresh products like the Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, and Vision Pro.But this year, Apple might be due for a breather as its iPhone sales slow down. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise just 3% and 7%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 (which ends this September) -- and those growth rates seem a bit low for a stock that trades at 28 times forward earnings.Apple might still be a good long-term investment, but investors shouldn\\'t be too surprised if its rally stalls out this year. Therefore, investors looking for some beefier gains should consider buying these three higher-growth stocks -- PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD), Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), and On Holding (NYSE: ONON) -- instead of Apple in 2024.PDD, more commonly known as Pinduoduo, is the third-largest e-commerce company in China after Alibaba and JD.com. However, it\\'s growing a lot faster than both of those market leaders.From 2018 to 2022, PDD\\'s revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 78%, and analysts expect it to continue expanding at a CAGR of 46% from 2022 to 2025. PDD also turned profitable in 2021, and its net profit nearly quadrupled in 2022. Analysts expect its net profit to increase at a CAGR of 41% from 2022 to 2025. Those are jaw-dropping growth rates for a stock that trades at just 19 times forward earnings.PDD initially carved out a high-growth niche with its discount marketplace, which encouraged China\\'s lower-income shoppers to team up and score steep discounts on bulk purchases. It then capitalized on its popularity to build an online agricultural platform that allowed farmers to directly ship their fresh produce to consumers.The company also recently expanded into the U.S. and Europe with Temu, a shopping app that allows its Chinese merchants to reach overseas shoppers. As PDD has expanded, its profitability has improved as its scales up its business and phases out its lower-margin first-party marketplace.PDD\\'s valuation is being compressed by the market\\'s aversion to Chinese stocks, but it could rally much higher if the regulatory headwinds dissipate and more investors recognize its explosive growth potential.Celsius sells sugar-free energy drinks made from natural ingredients like green tea, ginger, and amino acids. It claims its drinks have \"thermogenic\" properties that accelerate metabolism and burn body fat during workouts.That health-conscious approach enabled Celsius to grow rapidly over the past few years and become the third-largest energy drink brand in the U.S. after Red Bull and Monster Beverage. Celsius also signed a U.S. distribution deal with PepsiCo in 2022, which should significantly boost its retail presence and brand recognition. The company still generates most of its revenue from the U.S. market, but it plans to gradually expand internationally over the next three to five years.From 2018 to 2022, Celsius\\' revenue rose at a CAGR of 88%. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned positive in 2019 and grew at a CAGR of 160% over the following three years.From 2022 to 2025, analysts expect its revenue to expand at a CAGR of 53% as its adjusted EBITDA increases at a CAGR of 91%. Those are stunning growth rates for a stock that trades at 53 times next year\\'s adjusted EBITDA.On is a Swiss maker of athletic footwear and apparel. It\\'s a lot smaller than Nike and Adidas, but it\\'s growing at a much faster rate. From 2019 to 2022, its net sales rose at a CAGR of 66%. Analysts expect it to continue growing at a CAGR of 34% from 2022 to 2025.On\\'s shoes use its proprietary CloudTec cushions, which expand while a foot is airborne and lock down for a firmer foundation when it hits the ground. The popularity of its shoes -- along with endorsements from famous Swiss athletes like Nicola Spirig and Roger Federer -- enabled On to dominate the Swiss footwear market and gain footholds in the U.S. and Chinese markets.On turned profitable in 2022, and analysts expect its net profit to grow at a CAGR of 63% from 2022 to 2025.On, like athleisure leader Lululemon Athletica, sells its products at premium prices, tightly limits its markdowns, and is aggressively expanding its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel to boost its gross margins and reduce its dependence on wholesale retailers. That sounds like a recipe for long-term success, but its stock still trades just a few dollars above its initial public offering price and looks like a screaming bargain at 30 times forward earnings.Should you invest $1,000 in On Holding right now?Before you buy stock in On Holding, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and On Holding wasn’t one of them.

       "  \"Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) headed in opposite directions after their latest earnings reports. Meta's stock soared 20% to an all-time high on Feb. 2, after the social media giant followed up its big fourth-quarter earnings beat with rosy guidance for the first quarter, a $50 billion boost to its buyback plan, and the initiation of its first-ever dividend. Alphabet's stock sank 8% on Jan. 31, even though its fourth-quarter numbers easily cleared analysts' expectations with double-digit growth across its core businesses.As of this writing, Meta's stock has rallied more than 150% over the past 12 months. Alphabet's stock has rallied just over 30%. Let's see why the bulls rushed to Meta instead of Alphabet -- and if that trend will continue throughout the rest of 2024.Meta and Alphabet both generate most of their revenue from digital ads, but their business models are different. Meta is the world's largest social media company, and 3.98 billion people use at least one of its core apps -- Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- every month. It sells its ads across all four platforms, as well as its Audience Network for third-party apps and websites. It's also producing augmented and virtual reality devices through its Reality Labs segment.Alphabet's Google owns the world's largest search engine, the top streaming video platform in YouTube, and the most popular mobile operating system in Android. It also owns the world's third largest cloud infrastructure platform, sells its own first-party hardware devices, and develops self-driving vehicles through its Waymo subsidiary.Google and Facebook controlled 39% and 18% of the global digital advertising market in terms of annual revenue, respectively, in 2023. But both companies face stiff competition from ByteDance's TikTok, which claimed 3% of the market and continues to lock in younger audiences with its short videos. To counter TikTok, Google has been beefing up YouTube Shorts, while Meta has been expanding its similar Reels across Facebook and Instagram.Meta and Alphabet generated 98% and 77% of their revenue, respectively, from digital ads in 2023. Both companies struggled with slower ad sales in 2022, as the macro headwinds drove more businesses to rein their ad spending.Meta also struggled with Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) privacy changes on iOS, which made it tougher to craft targeted ads from third-party data. Google wasn't as affected by the iOS update, because it mainly relied on first-party data and already paid Apple billions of dollars each year to remain the default search engine on iOS. But despite all of those challenges, Meta's ad revenue grew at a much faster rate than Google's over the past year.MetricQ4 2022Q1 2023Q2 2023Q3 2023Q4 2023Meta ad revenue growth (YOY)(4%)4%12%24%24%Google ad revenue growth (YOY)(4%)0%3%9%11%Data source: Company earnings reports. YOY = Year over year.Meta outperformed Google for three reasons. First, Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies significantly ramped up their spending on Facebook and Instagram to reach more overseas users. Second, Meta countered Apple's changes by gathering more first-party data and upgrading its AI algorithms. Lastly, its higher ad impressions offset its lower ad prices.Google didn't seem to attract as much spending from those Chinese companies, and declining impressions across its sprawling ad network partly offset its rising impressions across its core search engine and YouTube. Google's growing dependence on ad-free subscriptions for YouTube and YouTube Music also suggested its advertising business was running out of steam. Meanwhile, Google's closely watched cloud business continued to grow at a slower rate than its larger rival, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, which implied it was falling behind in the cutthroat cloud and AI race.Meta's rising ad revenue, layoffs, and other cost-cutting measures boosted its operating margin from 25% in 2022 to 35% in 2023, even as it ramped up its spending in its unprofitable Reality Labs business. Alphabet also executed several rounds of layoffs, but its operating margin rose from 26% in 2022 to just 27% in 2023.Analysts expect Meta's revenue and earnings to grow 12% and 18%, respectively, in 2024. Based on those estimates, which might need to be raised after Meta's latest earnings beat, its stock doesn't look particularly expensive at 28 times forward earnings. Its forward yield of 0.4% won't attract any serious investors, but it's a clear sign that it can continue to generate a stable profit while expanding its metaverse ecosystem.Analysts expect Alphabet's revenue and earnings to rise 11% and 17%, respectively, in 2024. It doesn't pay a dividend yet, but its stock looks a bit cheaper at 21 times forward earnings. However, concerns about its advertising business and its ability to keep pace with Microsoft in the AI race could continue to compress its near-term valuations.It's a close call, but I believe Meta will continue to outperform Alphabet this year as its advertising growth accelerates and it expands its operating margin. Its simpler business model could also make it more appealing for growth-oriented investors.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

       "  'When it comes to success in emerging industries, size usually matters. Pioneers often fail, leaving behind the foundation for larger players to dominate. Thankfully for investors in mold-breaking upstarts, it doesn\\'t always play out that way.Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Sonos (NASDAQ: SONO), and Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) are three companies that saw Apple\\xa0and other consumer tech behemoths try to take them out. The little guys are not just surviving, but thriving against established titans with almost limitless resources. Take a bow Roku, Sonos, and Spotify.Roku founder Anthony Wood invented the digital video recorder, but it was another company that enjoyed the DVR glory. He got it right when he launched Roku a few years later, pioneering the streaming video revolution. It wasn\\'t long before Roku was joined by some of the most valuable companies on the planet. Apple TV, Alphabet\\'s Google Chromecast, and Amazon\\'s Fire TV hit the market. Roku didn\\'t flinch.Roku remains the leading operating system for smart TVs in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It has roughly double the market share of its closest rival. It doesn\\'t matter that Google and Amazon are willing to practically give away the hardware to get folks connected. Roku has been able to sacrifice product margins, knowing it can make it up in volume.Roku is free to use, making the lion\\'s share of its revenue from ad sharing and referrals. It\\'s working. Average revenue per user is more than $41 over the past year. There are 75.8 million active accounts on the platform, and boy are they active. Roku users are spending an average of 3.8 hours a day streaming through the Roku hub.It doesn\\'t seem possible. Roku is competing against Apple, a company that is used to getting people to pay a premium for its wares. Alphabet is the global leader in online advertising, putting it in the perfect position to cash in on an ad-supported industry. Amazon is the top dog in online retail, and it aggressively promotes its Fire TV dongles and smart TVs on its platform. Roku is still beating them all.Roku\\'s enemies are also rivals of Sonos. It was 2005 when Sonos rolled out the first wireless multiroom speaker system, which streams audio seamlessly through a home. Audiophiles flocked to Sonos, but then familiar foes emerged. Apple, Amazon, and Google all had cheap smart speakers in support of their virtual assistant technologies. Sonos was in their crosshairs if they chose to go upmarket, but they missed.Sonos would go on to deliver 17 consecutive years of revenue growth before proving mortal in fiscal 2023. On Tuesday afternoon it posted financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. It was a well-received report.Revenue declined 9%, or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. It\\'s not pretty, but analysts were bracing for a 13% decline. The bigger surprise is at the other end of the income statement. Profitability improved at Sonos, earning $0.64 a share for the seasonally potent holiday quarter, up from $0.57 a share a year earlier. Wall Street pros were settling for a sharp decline to $0.39 a share.\"Despite the challenging environment, we are winning in the market and outperforming the competition,\" CEO Patrick Spence said in this week\\'s earnings report.Rich in cash and patents, Sonos is well positioned to continue dominating its high-end niche. With analyst profit targets now likely headed higher, Sonos is cheap.Remember when everyone figured that Spotify was toast? The Swedish audio streaming service was making waves worldwide, but would it be able to succeed in the U.S. as Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Amazon Music flooded the market? It\\'s doing pretty well, even if it had to go through three rounds of layoffs last year.There are 602 million mostly ad-supported monthly active users, a 23% increase over the past year. Getting folks to pay is the more difficult nut to crack, but Spotify has been beefing up its catalog of original content to go with its industry-leading music platform. Premium Spotify accounts have risen 15% over the past year to reach 236 million.Apple and Amazon are distant competitors. Google Play Music threw in the towel, handing its digital ambitions over to YouTube Music. It\\'s going to be hard for the other streaming service stocks to catch up to Spotify now.Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

       "  'We’ve all had that moment where we realized we need to be wary of GPS. You track down a highly recommended restaurant on Google Maps only to find it moved location a couple of weeks ago. Or you take an Apple Maps-approved shortcut straight into a dead end. On rare occasions, you might even find yourself unwittingly bareling down a flight of Edinburgh steps.That last one might sound like hyperbole, but it’s an issue a surprising number of drivers in the capital of Scotland found themselves in over\\' the last couple of months.The issue became widespread enough that the City of Edinburgh council was forced to get in touch with Apple and Google to ask the tech giants to update their GPS, short for Global Positioning System, after out-of-date maps left multiple drivers stranded in a stairway beside a pub.The council installed steps on the city\\'s Greenside Lane and blocked the road off from traffic as part of street design guidance that sought to make the street similar to others in the city, including those linking to the famous Royal Mile.However, those updates weren’t reflected in Apple Maps or Google Maps, which continued to direct drivers down the path.Reports began to emerge last month that the issue was leading to cars getting stuck on the steps beside the Theatre Royal Pub, with the Metro reporting that a Toyota Prius and SUV were known victims of the mix-up.Try going down Greenside Lane! [Clue: Don’t] pic.twitter.com/iwAQVEzK68— Kiddy (@BellsdykeBairn) December 29, 2023Amused residents have taken to social media to publicize a trend that was at risk of becoming endemic, and also appears to have affected heavy-duty transit vans and delivery vehicles.One of those unfortunate people, an unnamed delivery driver, told BBC Scotland: \"I was just following the sat-nav. I always remember I used to come down this way. I followed it and just got stuck.”\"I had no idea there was a step there, I used to come down this way. I am a bit embarrassed about it.\"It\\'s happened again! Greenside Lane this afternoon. . . .#Edinburgh pic.twitter.com/ziht7lpqhi— Alan Wilson (@AlanWilson_SP) January 18, 2024In a paper published last week, the council said it had been made aware the change had led vehicles to careen into the steps.A representative for the City of Edinburgh told Fortune that Google had updated its GPS to reflect that Greenside Lane was no longer suitable for cars, while Apple had been asked to make a correction.Fortune has approached Apple for comment.An experiment carried out by Fortune using both Google Maps and Apple Maps shows drivers are no longer directed down Greenside Lane. A representative for Google confirmed to Fortune that it had updated its map as soon as it was made aware of the change.While it waited to confirm the maps had been updated, the council installed a temporary barrier to prevent further accidents from happening.Councillor Scott Arthur, the city’s transport and environment convener, said: “The footpath in this area is incredibly busy, so these incidents are really concerning.“While we would expect drivers to use common sense in a situation like this, we are going to install temporary barriers this week to prevent it happening again.“Sat Nav is an incredibly useful tool, but it’s no substitute for common sense. Cars and trucks don’t go down steps.”GPS, or as Brits call it, “sat-nav” (short for satellite navigation), has improved by leaps and bounds since it was first popularized among consumers as an in-car attachment.According to Google, the map is updated constantly or, to quote its maps group: “literally, every second of every day!\" The group appears to use a \"Swiss cheese model\" of risk management, where layered defenses minimize the possibility of a notable error occurring.“We’re constantly collecting new information about the world, whether from satellite imagery and Street View cars, or Google Maps users and local business owners, and using that information to update the map.”But smaller updates, including the placement of a few steps, are much harder for satellites to pick up on a map, and updates may slip through the net.On this occasion, it seems Google and Apple’s various avenues for updating the map fell short in Edinburgh.The accidents in Scotland\\'s capital, which didn’t lead to any reported injuries, offer a sobering reminder of the limits of modern-day technology, particularly as drivers begin to embrace the autonomous driving.And the incident serves as a reminder, next time you’re directed down a side street, to make sure to double-check what’s really there.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com'],\n",

       "  'As we enter February 2024, it’s a good time to reevaluate our portfolios and ensure we’re positioned for long-term growth. Tech stocks have been some of the best performers over the past two decades, with massive shifts towards AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing propelling future gains. While I often cover intriguing under-the-radar names, today I want to discuss seven timeless tech stocks that should form the enduring core of your portfolio.Many of us get distracted chasing the latest hot tech stock, but making emotional snap decisions often leads us astray. Instead, I recommend taking a deep breath and focusing on tech stalwarts with proven track records, dominant market positions, and secular growth trends that will drive revenue growth for years to come. These stocks may lack sky-high glamor but offer resilience and steady gains that outweigh short-term hype. Let’s take a look!Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comAs we kick off 2024, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains one of my highest conviction long-term holds. This tech titan has been firing on all cylinders under Satya Nadella’s leadership, which is evidenced by its meteoric rise to become the world’s most valuable company. If you look at Microsoft’s stock chart over the past decade, it paints a picture of outstanding compound growth that I expect to continue flowing in shareholders’ brokerage accounts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft struck gold by funding OpenAI, providing immense leverage over ChatGPT and other coveted AI models set to penetrate the mainstream. Cloud computing has also fueled tremendous growth lately, with no signs of slowing as enterprises rapidly migrate more workloads to Azure. Microsoft also wields additional leverage in nascent quantum computing, aggressive gaming pursuits, and flourishing subscription services. This diversified tech giant consistently makes the right moves to drive revenue.Despite steep gains, Microsoft still trades at a reasonable 36.5-times earnings. I think that’s a cheap valuation, relative to its quality and growth prospects. For a dominant firm generating $62 billion in quarterly sales and 18% year-over-year growth, I believe this multiple remains attractive for long-horizon investors. Indeed, MSFT stock deserves a premium valuation given its expanding moat and history of adapting to industry shifts decade after decade.In short, Microsoft checks all the boxes: visionary leadership, AI/cloud secular trends, reasonable valuation, fortress balance sheet, and a demonstrated capacity to penetrate new markets. That’s why I urge accumulating MSFT stock hand over fist if you have a 10-20-year investment horizon.Source: Castleski / Shutterstock.comGoogle parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been largely overlooked amid the AI hype cycle, but don’t sleep on this cash cow. Despite recent lackluster stock returns compared to big tech peers, GOOG stock has still rallied 22.5% annually over the past decade. Google’s Bard debacle also overshadowed that YouTube monetization is hitting its long-awaited stride.After decades of patience with YouTube’s ad potential, Alphabet is finally squeezing money from its neglected golden goose. Blocking ad blockers and adding more premium features like enhanced bitrate has allowed Google to pull all the right profitability leverage. Notably, these levers are being pulled while Alphabet enjoys unrivaled competitive moats around YouTube and Search. These platforms drive significant profit margins and serve billions of users each month. Sustainable double-digit growth is likely for years to come.Today, the company’s revenue sits at $307.4 billion, up 10% year over year. With YouTube pitching in $9.2 billion last quarter alone, Google has barely scratched the surface of maximizing this asset. Its latest Gemini AI upgrade also aims to challenge OpenAI’s model in capability. Even if inferior, don’t underestimate Google’s ability to monetize AI with its wealth of data and domains.For a dominant firm increasing sales 10%+ annually, GOOG stock’s valuation multiple of 21-times forward earnings seems reasonable, given its history of over-delivering. This is a buy-and-hold-forever stock if I’ve ever seen one.Source: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of underappreciated monetization efforts, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has executed a phenomenal turnaround since the pandemic lows. After subscriber declines and fears it would stay permanently impaired, Netflix made savvy strategic moves that reinvigorated growth and turbocharged its earnings power over the past year.It turns out those pandemic pull-forwards masked Netflix’s secular shift toward pricing power. Successfully cracking down on rampant password sharing, hiking subscription fees, and attracting wealthier customers have allowed impressive gains since my bullish call in November 2022. Additionally, Netflix is adding subscribers at a healthy clip, now that the dead weight has fallen off.With market-leading originals fueling must-have exclusivity and no viable competitors at scale, I believe Netflix enjoys immense latitude to drive further average revenue per user gains in Western markets. There’s still a long runway left for growth in emerging countries, even if a recession temporarily cools subscription momentum.I estimate Netflix will expand operating margins back to 25% within a few years from 16% currently, fueling 20%+ annual earnings per share growth for the foreseeable future. The market has turned too bearish here just as Netflix enters its golden age. I suggest buying more on any dips – this comeback story has plenty of gas left in the tank, both fundamentally and optically, now that positive sentiment has returned.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comI’ve been pounding the table on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) (formerly Facebook) for two years now, first calling it a “buy” around $112 in 2022. In October 2023, I projected a move to $400 per share by 2024, driven by ad revenue resilience and metaverse potential. We fell a bit short, since META ended 2023 near $350, but it now trades around $460 per share post-market as of writing.Four months ago, I\\xa0said,“Meta does not pay a dividend, unlike many mature tech stocks, and its valuation seems fair based on 2023 estimates. If Meta did return cash to shareholders instead of investing heavily in its metaverse vision, a dividend could make it more appealing for long-term investors.”Just as I suggested last fall, Meta announced a quarterly 50 cent per share dividend hours ago (as of writing), alongside a $50 billion share buyback authorization. This capital return program demonstrates management’s confidence in continued free cash flow generation even with heavy Reality Labs investment dragging on earnings. The dividend also sets a new tone for Meta as a shareholder-friendly tech giant capable of balancing growth prospects with delivering direct value today.I’m not going to backpedal now that META stock is trading where it is. That price tag still looks attractive for long-term investors due to the new buyback program and dividend. The company’s core advertising business boasts tremendous staying power thanks to unrivaled user engagement and data advantages. Meanwhile, Metaverse initiatives will bear fruit over the next decade across consumer and enterprise applications.Patience has already paid off for believers in this dominant social media ecosystem. Now, income and buybacks provide extra incentives alongside an improving growth narrative. I suggest buying more META stock, and holding forever. My October bull case assumed $500 per share by the end of 2025. I think $600 is achievable now.Is that a stretch? We’ll see.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAnother veteran tech company making strides lately is International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), which I flagged a year ago,\\xa0saying, “IBM will likely grow much faster in the future as it is making a turnaround by shifting its focus to cloud computing, AI, and blockchain.”Sure enough, Big Blue is back after years of sluggishness. Strategic imperatives like hybrid cloud, security, and AI now generate most of IBM’s sales. Quantum hardware remains a key differentiator, too – IBM recently unveiled its new 433-qubit Osprey processor while competitors are far behind.Up 37% in one year, IBM seems to be regaining its groove. The company’s cloud, AI/ML, quantum, and blockchain segments indicate an effective pivot toward the most promising future technologies. Renewed revenue growth and expanding margins further cement my confidence. IBM should keep outpacing as enterprises quest to extract value from data across hybrid environments.Source: Ivan Marc / Shutterstock.comShifting gears, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has endured a painful stretch along with the broader electric vehicle complex. TSLA stock is down 24% just since 2024 began as spiking rates, inflation, and gloomy macro forecasts create strong headwinds for automakers. Competition is also heating up, with BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) quickly moving up the ranks in terms of global EV sales.Nonetheless, I remain staunchly bullish on Tesla over any investment horizon beyond 12-18 months. At less than $190 per share, as I write this, TSLA stock trades at the cheapest valuation I’ve seen since April 2023.Rates won’t stay high forever. Inflation continues to moderate, as well. Once economic storm clouds clear, Tesla will still provide immense growth potential as the de facto leader of a rapidly-emerging mobility market. China’s production issues should sort themselves out over time, too. This creates a compelling risk/reward setup for patient investors.I expect TSLA stock to regain $300+ per share within two years as macro drags fade and the company’s vertical integration engine kicks back into high gear. EV penetration still stands very low globally. Thus, Tesla remains the best EV option to capitalize on mainstream adoption.Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comLast and admittedly, the least conviction pick from my end, is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The world’s most valuable public company (depending on the day) has essentially traded sideways for six months now, absent any compelling growth narrative. iPhone sales still dominate the company’s top line, while tablets, personal computers, and wearables contribute much less individually. Unfortunately, streaming remains a money pit.Rumors suggest the company is cooking up an autonomous electric vehicle behind closed doors. However, I wouldn’t bank on such a product moving the needle soon, even if released eventually. Meanwhile, Apple has largely remained on the AI sidelines, forfeiting major performance potential versus peers aggressively pursuing this vertical.Nonetheless, shares seem reasonably valued at around 30-times earnings. The company’s Services and Accessories segments continue to grow nicely as Apple’s installed base marches higher. While unlikely to rally sharply anytime soon, I don’t see much downside risk to AAPL stock either. Steady dividend increases and buybacks are likely to provide extra support.For now, Apple looks stuck in the mud – an acceptable hold, but not one I’m excited to buy more of amid fierce sector rotation. Still, its fortress balance sheet and ecosystem stickiness should prevent meaningful underperformance if tech stabilizes. I rank AAPL stock a tepid buy simply due to its relative resilience.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

       "  'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) might seem like a good buy from a certain point of view. The company recently released its Vision Pro goggles, arguably its most notable new product release in years.However, the pride of Cupertino faces considerable headwinds that could limit growth in the near term. While investors should not give up on Apple stock, its prospects for beating the market over time have become increasingly uncertain.First, investors need some perspective when it comes to Apple. With its array of popular products and services, as well as its $173 billion in liquidity, it has one of the most solid balance sheets in existence.Additionally, it continues to benefit from the success of the iPhone, and even amid its struggles, iPhone sales rose 6% in its fiscal 2024 first quarter (which ended Dec. 30), making up 58% of Apple\\'s revenue.Nonetheless, one could forgive investors for not wanting to add Apple shares to their portfolios right now. Its sales in the Greater China market experienced a 13% yearly decline in the latest quarter. Overall, Apple\\'s quarterly revenue grew by only 2% year over year to $120 billion.Also, since the death of Steve Jobs in 2011, the company\\'s development of obviously innovative products has slowed considerably. To Apple\\'s credit, it released the Apple Watch in 2015 and experienced some success with its array of Apple Services offerings. Still, the pipeline of innovations has felt fairly dry in recent years.Lately, it has developed the Apple Vision Pro, which it describes as the first \"spatial computer,\" combining digital content with physical spaces. This virtual reality headset offers more functionality than the Meta Quest 3 VR goggles sold by Meta Platforms.However, the Vision Pro costs more than three times as much as Meta\\'s most advanced Quest model, the Meta Quest Pro, and it remains to be seen if customers will pay that kind of premium for Apple Vision Pro.Additionally, investors should ask if that current value proposition is worth paying 30 times earnings for the stock. This is well above its P/E ratio in the 2010s, when it rarely rose above 20. It was at that time that Warren Buffett\\'s Berkshire Hathaway first began buying Apple shares.When Berkshire started to invest in Apple, the stock traded at about 12 times earnings. Even as the P/E ratio rose to 18, the share purchases continued. Buffett sold some shares between 2018 and 2020 -- decisions he would later regret -- and subsequently resumed the share purchases.However, Berkshire\\'s last Apple purchase was in the first quarter of 2023, and with Apple making up nearly half of the value of Berkshire\\'s stock portfolio (and the conglomerate holding almost 6% of Apple\\'s outstanding shares), Berkshire could have a considerable incentive to reduce its Apple exposure. If Berkshire sells some Apple shares, other investors could follow, putting a cap on Apple\\'s near-term share price growth.All things considered, investors should stay on the sidelines with Apple for now. Admittedly, its massive cash hoard makes a sustained decline in the stock unlikely. The question is where it will go from here, as I see no certain path for significant growth. Moreover, with the stock trading at a 30 P/E ratio, it provides no obvious avenue for multiple expansion, a factor that\\'s likely to limit its stock returns further. That could prompt Berkshire Hathaway to sell some of its shares, which in turn could negatively influence the stock.Ultimately, Apple should remain a top consumer and technology holding, and longtime shareholders have good reason to maintain their Apple positions. Nonetheless, until the company offers a more obvious path to outsized growth, investors have little reason to buy more Apple stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

       "  'You\\'d be hard-pressed to find a bigger Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) bull than Warren Buffett. The legendary investor has led Berkshire Hathaway to build a stake in Apple worth over $170 billion. That makes the tech giant Berkshire\\'s biggest holding by far. It also makes Berkshire Hathaway the third-largest Apple shareholder, trailing two huge fund managers.But all things come to an end eventually. Will Buffett soon begin selling Berkshire Hathaway\\'s massive position in Apple stock?This could seem like an absurd question to pose. However, it\\'s not a farfetched idea that Buffett might consider selling Apple, perhaps over the next few quarters.I\\'d rank valuation as the top potential reason for Buffett selling Apple because it\\'s always a top consideration for him. Apple\\'s shares currently trade at 28 times expected earnings. That wouldn\\'t be a ridiculously high forward-earnings multiple if the company was delivering stellar growth, but Apple isn\\'t.In Apple\\'s fiscal 2024 first quarter, which ended on Dec. 30, 2023, the company reported year-over-year revenue growth of only 2%. And that underwhelming level came on the heels of record-high services revenue.There\\'s no compelling reason to expect Apple to return to strong growth anytime soon. China remains a weak spot. Although the newly released Vision Pro mixed-reality device is wowing a lot of customers, it\\'s unlikely to move the needle much financially over the near term.Another possibility is that Buffett could want to land an \"elephant\" (his term for making a big acquisition). While Berkshire has a cash stockpile of $152 billion, he could still want to keep some powder dry in case the stock market plunges and creates lots of great buying opportunities.We only have to look at one of Buffett\\'s most famous quotes to get a feel for why he might prefer that Berkshire hold onto its big position in Apple. In 1989, he wrote to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders: \"[W]hen we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"There\\'s still a good reason to view Apple as an outstanding business with an outstanding management team. For example, during the latest quarter, the company generated nearly $40 billion in operating cash flow and returned close to $27 billion to shareholders. And while Apple\\'s revenue grew by only 2% year over year, its earnings per share jumped 16% to a record high.Apple\\'s ecosystem remains strong with extraordinarily loyal customers. The company\\'s installed base of active devices topped 2.2 billion in its fiscal Q1. One recent survey found that four of the top five best-selling smartphones in the U.S. and Japan were iPhones. This provides a great foundation for the company to continue growing its services business.Dismissing the impact of Vision Pro could also be shortsighted. Apple CEO Tim Cook isn\\'t exaggerating when he said in the company\\'s quarterly conference call that it\\'s \"the most advanced personal electronics device ever.\" Apple could have a huge long-term growth opportunity in spatial computing.Let\\'s put aside the question of why Buffett might or might not sell Apple stock and return to our original question: Will he soon begin selling the stock? I wouldn\\'t rule out the possibility that he will. However, I think it\\'s highly unlikely.In Berkshire\\'s annual shareholder meeting held in May 2023, Buffett stated that Apple is a \"better business\" than any of the conglomerate\\'s fully owned subsidiaries. Based on that comment, you could argue that it\\'s more likely that Berkshire sells GEICO than that it slashes its position in Apple.That said, I don\\'t expect Buffett will buy any additional shares of Apple in 2024 barring a major sell-off. Valuation is still important to him, and Apple\\'s valuation is indisputably high.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Ek; Founder, CEO & Chairman; Spotify Technology S.A.Paul Aaron Vogel; CFO; Spotify Technology S.A.Unidentified Company RepresentativeOperatorGood morning, and welcome to Spotify's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Bryan Goldberg, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.Bryan Daniel GoldbergAll right. Thanks, operator, and welcome to Spotify's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us today will be Daniel Ek, our CEO; Paul Vogel, our CFO; and Ben Kung, our VP of Financial Planning and Analysis, who has been assisting with the transition while we search for our new CFO. We'll start with opening comments from Daniel and Paul. And afterwards, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Questions can be submitted by going to slido.com, s-l-i-d-o.com and using the code #SpotifyEarningsQ423. Analysts can ask questions directly into Slido, and all participants can then vote on the questions they find the most relevant. If for some reason, you don't have access to Slido, you can e-mail Investor Relations at ir@spotify.com, and we'll add in your question. Before we begin, let me quickly cover the safe harbor. During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements, including projections or estimates about the future performance of the company. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed on today's call, in our shareholder deck and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we'll also refer to certain non-IFRS financial measures. Reconciliations between our IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures can be found in our shareholder deck, in the financial section of our Investor Relations website and also furnished today on Form 6-K. And with that, I'll turn it over to Daniel.Daniel G. EkAll right. Thanks, Bryan, and hey, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I hope you've had the opportunity to review our shareholder deck to get a sense of what an incredible year 2023 was for Spotify. Throughout the year, we notched some really significant milestones and set numerous records. This included 113 million net adds on the MAU side and premium net adds of 31 million, both the biggest full year additions in our history. And our annual Wrapped experience also toppled previous levels of engagement surpassing 2022 numbers in just the first 31 hours of the campaign. We accomplished all of this by significantly exceeding our own expectations when we entered the year and against the backdrop of global turmoil and uncertainty and Q4 was a continuation of the story. And while I'm pleased with the level of growth we saw in 2023, perhaps what is even more gratifying is that it also marked a very different year for Spotify, a true evolution in how we operate our company. A year where we started to prove that we're not just a company that has an amazing product, but one that also is building a great business. And there's no question that we had to make some difficult decisions to put us on track to achieve our goal of being a consistently profitable company but by taking these steps, I'm super confident in where we're heading. So looking to 2024, you should expect a continuation of what you saw in 2023, strong product development, which leads to strong growth, but with an increased focus on monetization and efficiency, which in turn drives profitability. And I know some of you may start to wonder if we're sacrificing growth for profitability. Long term, we believe that the real value of Spotify is in solving problems at the intersection between creators and consumers . With scale, there will be even more opportunities to do so. Therefore, growth is still the most important thing we can deliver. However, equally true is that our hurdle rate for investment has increased. So what gifts? Well, as I've shared before, we have various levers to pull at different times to drive revenue growth. These include growing our users, creating new businesses with new revenue streams and increasing revenue per user through price increases. In 2023, we leveraged all three throughout the year at various times, but this won't always be the case, you should expect to see a shift back and forth among prioritizing these three key elements based on a variety of considerations. And looking ahead, I believe 2024 is going to be another year of solid progress led by an acceleration of revenue growth. That said, I think it is important to remind investors that we constantly modulate between what we spend most of our time focusing on. In some years, it's focusing on growing the top of the funnel. And in some years, it's about driving monetization of those users. The last few years has been extraordinary from the top of the funnel perspective. Our aim is to continue this trend, but our focus in 2024 is more on how we monetize that growth. I also wanted to provide a quick update on our audio books business, which is performing well, and we are very excited about its potential. It's still early days, but the feedback from listeners and from the industry is extremely encouraging. Data shows that our entry into this market has dramatically accelerated its overall growth. In Q4, we became the #2 provider of audio books behind Audible, which is notable given how entrenched the legacy players are. And this is exactly what we set out to do: grow the pie for the publishing industry and expand the interest in audio books to an entirely new set of listeners. More to come as this takes hold and we roll it out through additional markets. Before I turn it over to Paul to provide more details on the numbers, I also wanted to take this opportunity with all of you on the line to thank him and wish him well. Although Paul is sticking around for a couple more months, this will be his last earnings call. He's been a great partner and helped to solidify the position of the strength that we sit in today. So thank you, Paul, for these years. I also wanted to give you a quick update on our CFO search. We are well underway, and I'm happy with the caliber of the candidates that I'm seeing. As we enter this next phase of focusing on having both a great product and building a great business, I'm confident we will find the right person, someone who is passionate about driving the levels of efficiency and resourcefulness that are critical to our long-term success. Paul, thanks again, and over to you.Paul Aaron VogelGreat. Thanks, Daniel, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'd like to add a bit more color on the quarter and then touch upon the broader performance of the business and our outlook. Q4 is a very strong quarter. MAU grew like 28 million to 602 million, and we added 10 million net subscribers finishing at 236 million. Both MAU and subscriber growth continued to be above our historical trend and outperformed forecast. Revenue grew 16% year-over-year to EUR 3.7 billion during the quarter. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency movements, revenue grew 20% year-on-year, representing an acceleration of 300 basis points versus the prior quarter as a result due to the ongoing effects of the new subscription pricing. Turning to gross margin. Gross margin of 26.7% was above guidance by about 10 basis points due primarily to favorability in our podcast business. We reported an operating loss of EUR 75 million, which was better than guidance due mainly to lower-than-expected marketing spend and personnel and related costs. As we previously disclosed, our operating loss was impacted by about EUR 143 million of charges related to the efficiency actions we announced in December. Excluding the onetime charges, we generated EUR 68 million of adjusted operating profit, which is more than double the third quarter as the business continued its early stage of inflection towards sustainable growth and profitability. Finally, Free cash flow was positive EUR 396 million in Q4. While some of the strength was timing related, we remain confident that we've entered a new chapter in terms of expanding the business, the business's cash generation potential. Looking ahead to the first quarter guidance, we are forecasting 618 million MAU, an increase of 16 million from Q4 and 230 million subscribers, an increase of 3 million over Q4. We're also forecasting a currency-neutral revenue growth rate of 20% plus year-on-year putting to EUR 3.6 billion in total revenue. We also anticipate a gross margin of 26.4% and an operating profit of EUR 180 million. While we no longer give full year guidance, we do expect healthy full year 2024 user growth that should be close to the average of the last few years, and we expect strong subscriber growth as well. Gross margin and operating margin are both expected to improve throughout the year to deliver meaningful full year expansion with podcasting expected to deliver positive gross profit for the year. We also expect our free cash flow generation to meaningfully exceed what we generated in 2023. And finally, as Bryan mentioned, Ben Kung, who has been a trusted partner of (inaudible) Finance, is also on the call and we're joining us for Q&A. And additionally, I'd like to thank Daniel and all of my colleagues over the past 8 years for making my time at Spotify truly special. And with that, I'll hand things back to Bryan for Q&A.Bryan Daniel GoldbergAll right. Thanks, Paul. Again, if you've got any questions, please go to slido.com, #SpotifyEarningsQ423. We're going to be reading the questions in the order they appear in the queue with respect to how people vote up their preference for questions.Bryan Daniel GoldbergAnd our first question is going to come today from Doug Anmuth on podcasting. Have podcasts flipped into positive gross profit yet? And how do you think about inflection here through '24 as you're rationalizing content spending?Daniel G. EkYes, I'll take this one, Doug. Yes. So I think just to level set with everyone, I think when we had our Investor Day last year, everyone was probably expecting our podcast business to be a net adder to the business and probably thought that the music margins was worse than what they ended up being and obviously, as we outlined then, podcasting was a drag to the business, but something we were committed to turn around. And I'm pleased to say in Q4, we were very close to breakeven on that business, which gives me a lot of confidence that as we get into 2024, we will achieve the full year profitability target on podcasting. And so when you think about then, what are the drivers for that to happen? Well, it's really two drivers. On the top line side, we're still seeing healthy growth on engagements. That engagement in turns means there will be more opportunities for us to monetize those engagement hours, and that's the top line. And then on the bottom line, we have doubled down on the deals that worked, and we have got -- really throughout 2023, gotten out of a lot of the deals that didn't work. And that's the result you're now seeing with the close to breakeven and that then will lead to a positive podcasting business in 2024.Bryan Daniel GoldbergAll right. Our next question is going to come from Michael Morris on margins. What are the most impactful steps that will help you progress towards your long-term music gross margin goal of 30% to 35%? And can you share more detail on the gross margin levers in 2024 and the relative impact you anticipate from each?Unidentified Company RepresentativeGreat question, Michael. In terms of the progress on the music margin goals, we see a lot of potential in the growth of our marketplace products as we continue to focus on driving adoption of those and adding value to our label partners and therefore, sort of building upon the progress that we've already made to date in that area. In terms of 2024, I think you've called out some of the key levers with respect to your comment on Q1. Really, the story of 2024, I think, can be broken into sort of these 3 parts. It's a continuation of the journey on profitability and podcasting. It's the continuation of marketplace growth, as I mentioned, and also just gaining greater efficiency and leverage in our other cost of revenue areas such as cloud cost and streaming delivery. We think all three are equal parts important to the story in 2024. And so we're looking forward to building on that progress there.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. We've got a question now from Rich Greenfield on advertising. With advertising revenues still under 14% of your revenues. I'm surprised to see it's not growing faster than subscription revenue. How do you accelerate advertising growth to reach your goals of it becoming 20% plus of your overall revenues?Paul Aaron VogelYes, I'd say a couple of things here. So first, I think we're very pleased with how advertising is growing. Obviously, the market -- a lot of ways continues to be choppy, but our FX-neutral high-teens growth on the advertising side, we think is really strong and really strong relative to the industry overall. So we feel good about kind of the advertising growth. That's number one. Number 2 is, we've obviously seen on the subscriber side, it is faster growth on subscribers in general, plus we've had a price increase. And so just the overall growth on the premium side has probably been even faster than maybe we would have thought and others would have thought when you factor in both the outside subscriber growth and the price increase. And the last thing I'd also just remind you of the advertising business does get impacted more significantly by FX than the premium business. And so when you're thinking about just reported numbers, that also has an impact on sort of the progression. But I think we feel really good about both sides of the businesses right now. So everything is progressing as planned.Bryan Daniel GoldbergAll right. We've got a follow-up from Rich Greenfield on podcasting. How should we think about the revenue opportunity and gross margin impact of shifting from an exclusive podcast like Call Her Daddy or Joe Rogan to nonexclusive?Daniel G. EkYes, Rich. So I think to kind of up level and talk about it generally and remind people. So when we walked into podcasting, we actually went in with multiple strategies at once. We did exclusives that you're referencing to, but we also did our own and original programming, and we also did licensed nonexclusive deals, too. And what we said at the time, I think many people mostly sort of made a reference to thinking that this was an all-out exclusive effort similar to that of Netflix. But we said we take much more of an opportunity approach to the strategy and we're going to try many different things. And for some shows, exclusive matters for some others, it don't. So I think the general story, just to be candid here with all of you on the line is that, what we've seen is that while exclusivities were net positive on the side, it's not driving as much as the opportunity that we see on the ad side. And so by broadening distribution, we think we can accomplish a number of different goals. Most notable among them, we are going to be more aligned with the creator. The creator obviously wants to be on many different platforms and wants to have as big of an audience as possible. So that's important. And then the second part is, when you think about the revenue growth story on advertising, we're very excited with what we've been seeing in early 2023 with these new types of deals that we've been structuring because we really become aligned with the creator. And long term, that is the reason why I started Spotify. We care equally about consumers, and we care equally about creators. So I feel like with this new strategy, we're actually even better aligned with the creator because we're not asking the creator to trade one for the other. And because advertising is in such a strong growth position for us, I feel I'm really excited about the opportunity we can bring both the creators and to Spotify itself with that strategy.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. Our next question comes from Zach Morrissey on Marketplace. Can you provide an update on marketplace and how that performed in 2023? And how should we think about momentum into '24?Paul Aaron VogelYes. Marketplace performed really well in '23. The growth rate, basically the contribution to gross profit grew at similar rates to 2022. So really strong growth in '23. And then just to reiterate what Ben said prior about overall gross margin, when you think about the improvements and gross margin moving to 2024, marketplace will be a key contributor, again, along with the podcasting flip and some of the other costs of revenue.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. We've got a follow-up from Zach. You saw strong subscriber growth and marketing leverage in 2023, how are you thinking about marketing spend in 2024? And do you see more room for further efficiencies?Daniel G. EkYes. And just as a reminder to everyone, this is something I talked about, I believe, during the Q1 earnings call in 2023, where I was positively surprised and some of the efficiencies we were seeing is still sort of healthy top line growth. And that trend has been continuing for much of 2023. And the reality is we don't know how far that will go. I feel good about the efficiencies we're seeing so far. The big concern always when you're making these things is you may see some healthy positive responses intra-quarter, but then long term, are you impacting the brand. So we're always going to modulate towards that. But -- but I think what we've been seeing so far has just been pure efficiencies and quite great ones. And I expect there's still some, but the question is still internally, we're still debating how much? The most important thing for us, as I said, is long-term growth still for the company. So that's what we will optimize for. And I think you're going to see us modulate between the quarters. Some quarters we may spend a little bit more on some less. The most important metric for all of you, though, is to think about the LTV to SAC. We referenced this before. It had been in 2022 and 2023 going down, the efficiency in some of our spend. Now you're going to see a higher hurdle rates. So we're going to be a lot more diligent as we're thinking about these marketing investments overall. But the spending per quarter may be more opportunistic, and you should think about it as such. But if you see a strong LTV to SAC, why wouldn't you? And that's the approach we take.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. Our next question is going to come from Eric Sheridan on operating priorities. Following your fourth quarter restructuring, what's your updated view about balancing long-term growth investments, accelerating the pathway to long-term margin targets in the next few years? And/or optimizing internal efficiency on an annualized basis?Daniel G. EkYes, I'll start and then Paul or Ben, if you want to chime in on that. Yes. I mean, I really talked about it in my introductory remarks, but it is a new way for us to operate as a company, one where we're consistently thinking about efficiency all the time top line. We started doing it in early 2023, and I think we are gradually becoming better quarter-by-quarter. And I think investors should expect the same much for 2024. We are going to continuously look at being more resourceful with the resources we have. That's just the new modus operandi that we have. But that said, that obviously leads to a concern then, okay, well, are we doing that to sacrifice at the expense of growth? And the answer should be, of course, not. That's not at all what we want to do. We still care about long-term growth because we believe that's where we're going to be able to solve real and meaningful problems for consumers and creators alike with scale. So that's our real focus. But it's a constant balancing act. And I think what you're seeing us rather than sort of growth at all cost or growth, growth, growth, you're going to see us quarter-by-quarter optimizing at various parts of that funnel. Sometimes it's top line growth, sometimes it's bottom line. As a general trend, we had healthy top line growth in 2023. 2024 is about monetizing more of that top line growth. That's the general trend. But you'll see in various geographies, we may have just MAU growth as the goal and in some others, it may be more of a just ARPU approach as an example.Paul Aaron VogelYes. I would just add, I think to everything Daniel said, if you think about the free cash flow and the acceleration of free cash flow and the better profitability, it just gives the business so much more optionality in terms of what it can do moving forward. And so I think you've seen that sort of inflection on the free cash flow side, you've now seen us on an adjusted basis, profitable for two quarters in a row with the forecast again for Q1 of next year. And so all that just puts the business in a much better place for the team to have the optionality to invest in areas that really makes sense for the long term.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. Our next question is going to come from Rich Greenfield on audio books. What surprises you most about the current state of the audio book market?Daniel G. EkYes, Rich, I think it's two parts of focus. So I think on our side, the intriguing part is we are able to bring a whole new audience to audio books. So internally and externally, I think the biggest surprise has been the type of titles that resonate with consumers. These are not the normal titles that traditionally does well, that do well on Spotify, and that's pleasing to see because that means we're bringing a whole new audience to audio books, the format, which is great to see. And then I think overall, I'm just happy to see that the partners we have on the publisher side and the author sides are just very excited about the innovation we're bringing and very open-minded to trying new things. And this is an industry that's so important, I think, to the world. And it's great to see that there is a hunger and willingness to innovate among all of our partners there. So that's definitely been a positive surprise. And it's amazing to see also how much value audio books is adding to our subscriber base. So I feel really good about that.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. Next question is from Benjamin Black on margins. Last quarter, you mentioned 2024 gross margin should exceed those of 2023. Is that still the case? And if so, how should we be thinking about the trajectory of gross margins throughout 2024?Unidentified Company RepresentativeThanks, Benjamin. Building on my earlier commentary, we feel very excited about the potential for 2024 gross margins. I mentioned some of the building blocks that we have ahead of us kind of going into this year. And I think you should expect that we're going to continue focusing on what we did in 2023, which is building sequential growth in that gross margin, and it's about executing against those building blocks of opportunity that we have that I mentioned previously.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. Our next question is going to come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich on the music business. Universal Music Group just pulled their music from TikTok. What are the implications to Spotify from a competitive standpoint? And how does this impact, if at all, your negotiations with your recorded music partners?Daniel G. EkYes. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on any sort of competitive dynamic. But what I can say is we feel really good about our relationship with our music partners. It's probably at the best it's been. I don't know, whatever, it's been better, to be honest. So I feel really good about where we are with our music partners. I feel great about the value we're bringing to the music industry. And I think that's being widely recognized. And yes, I don't think it has much of an implication, any other competitive dynamic but we feel good about the partnership. We feel great about opportunities to enhance the partnership to any extent that, that creates opportunities. So yes, we're overall very excited.Bryan Daniel GoldbergAll right. Our next question is from Maria Ripps audio books. Could you talk about what type of engagement you've seen with the free 15 hours of audio books listening? To what extent do you think the expanded value proposition is driving any of the subscriber momentum? And are you seeing any uplift to audio books purchases in the relevant markets?Daniel G. EkYes, Maria. So I mentioned that in my prior response, but the engagement has been very strong, very positively surprised about the content mix. It's driving as well what type of titles that our consumers are engaging with not very surprising. It is a lot of entertainment. It's a lot about culture. Maybe some of the titles that traditionally doesn't do as well in the book market, but also pleasing is very many younger authors, newer authors as well given the model where you can take a chance on a totally new book without sort of eating up the credit, which I think kind of drove you towards more safer bets. So we're seeing a very, very interesting sort of trend around the content consumption, which is really great and I believe, additive to the entire book industry, which is amazing. Now as it relates to how that translates into our business, I think it's too early to say but what we've seen generally speaking is the more engagement we have on our platform, the better the value is of course and then everyone knows that audio books is an expensive proposition where buying an audio books today costs a lot of money. So it's another reason why we're offering a great value to our consumers. And that, of course, gives us an ability to increase the value that then allows us long term to follow through by reflecting that in the price that we have as well to our consumers.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. Next question from Justin Patterson on revenue potential. Investors now have confidence in your operating margin potential and the redesigned app is resonating with users. As you look ahead, what should give investors confidence in your revenue growth, achieving the 20% targets outlined at your Investor Day?Daniel G. EkI'll start with this one, Ben, and then maybe you can chime in. So I think, again, this is very much a continuation of the trend of 2023. And just to level set again, 2023, we walked into the year thinking that we'll have healthy top line growth and focus on the bottom line on efficiencies and that was pretty much the year, but we exceeded all of our expectations on the MAU side, which then translated into exceeding all of our expectations on the sub side and then when you top off that with price increases, that leads to a very healthy dynamic. And that top line growth has really been a continuation of that trend in all of 2023. So I've said this before, but I'll say it again, MAU growth sooner or later then translate into conversion to subscriber that sooner or later then translate into revenue growth that sooner or later then translates into bottom line. And so given 2023, I feel really good about our ability to have healthy revenue growth throughout the year and with this smaller cost structures that we're having because of the focus on efficiency that we had really throughout 2023, we talked about it on the podcasting side. We talked about it on the employee side but also, as Ben mentioned, with cloud costs, all the other things that we've been focusing on, that should give you confidence that 2024 will be a great year. I don't know if you have any addition, Ben?Unidentified Company RepresentativeYes. No, I think all that commentary is very much sort of the perspective going forward. The top -- the funnel kind of our user side and subside looks very strong. And I think the focus is about sort of monetizing that, both from a premium subscription perspective as well as focusing on making sure that our ad business continues to grow at a healthy clip going forward. So we feel really strong about sort of progressing towards the 20% targets.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. Our next question is going to come from Kannan Venkateshwar on product. Given the pricing is a bigger part of the growth algorithm. Have you considered models beyond the All-You-Can-Eat framework used today?Daniel G. EkIn fact, we actually already do have some other pricing mechanics throughout the world. It's easy to think that Spotify is a single proposition for everyone in the world. It's far from today. So for instance, we have a day passes, it's just one product that we're offering in certain markets, week passes. We even have physical gift cards that people scratch cards from on a weekly basis in order to top up their Spotify listening. So we are very much adapting our pricing models in favor of what consumers want. And that's something that you should expect us to continue to do. Now with that said, to touch a little bit, one of the things, of course, why we are talking about the Apple case is many things like, for instance, a la carte purchases, things like superfan things like purchasing of audio books, top-up things that could be quite meaningful for Spotify's revenues is a significant hindrance today because Apple insists on taking a 30% cut, which in many cases, exceeds even our own cuts that we're able to take inside of the app. So some of these more innovative things that we would like to do, we are currently restricted in doing on the iOS ecosystem, which limits some of that more innovative things that we would like to do. So yes, all in all, we are already doing it in other territories. We would like to do even more of it. But to do that, certainly in the Western world, which many of these markets being very heavily iOS influenced, we are precluded from doing it at a way where -- which could be profitable and good for consumers and creators because of Apple stance.Bryan Daniel GoldbergAll right. That's a good segue into Michael Morris' question on the Digital Markets Act. You posted twice about the DMA with the potential positives to your business and then also about your dissatisfaction with Apple's proposed changes. Do you expect the DMA to be implemented in a way that supports your vision? And if so, what do you expect the new functions to be available? And how may they impact the company financially?Daniel G. EkMichael, I think the truth is we don't know yet. The -- we outline our response to how we would be compliant with the DMA. But obviously, that then very much depends on Apple stance in allowing us to do so. And Apple then obviously subsequently responded with their stance, which is very much incongruent with our stance on the matter and frankly, I think it's a bit of a forest because it looks on the surface that they're complying with it but behind the surface, they're doing pretty much everything to make this such an attractive experience that's no same developer want to pick any of the new terms. Now the good news, I guess, from the investor standpoint, and I know that there initially with some questions about whether or not this would be a downside for Spotify. I don't think that's the case. So we still have the ability to be on the old terms and keep going as we're currently going. But there are future upsides that could be quite significant. We talked a little bit about it with fan clubs, all these other things that we could do for creators that we would probably be barred from doing because it simply means that all of Spotify would be unprofitable if we took these new terms. So no downside, but there will be quite a lot of upside if, in fact, we were going to be able to do what we wanted to do, not just for Spotify, but for creators and consumers alike. And just as a last reminder, this law will come into play in March 7. So obviously, my hope is still very much that the European Commission will take action and allow this to happen because it will be far greater for the ecosystem, both for consumers and creators alike.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. Our next question comes from Batya Levi on audio books. How should we think about the impact of audio books consumption cost on margins?Paul Aaron VogelYes. Thanks, Batya. So as you know, we don't really break out the individual components like that. What I will say is while we're investing in audio books, we still see a nice improvement in gross margin through 2024, which Ben has talked about at length already on the call. And so -- we feel like we have a model for audio books and the progression of audio books over the next couple of years. It's going to be very additive. We've talked about at the Investor Day where we believe the long-term gross margin of the audio books business can get to. And so we're still really encouraged about that. And in general, we're very optimistic that you're going to continue to see gross margin progression throughout 2024.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. We've got another question from Kannan, this time on the music business. Has growth in international markets helped flip any major ones from fixed minimum payouts to variable payouts? And could we see some impact in 2024?Unidentified Company RepresentativeGreat question, Kannan. The short version -- the short answer to this question is yes. I would say that it's been a story of steady progress in sort of how we grow the user base and then begin to monetize them in these international markets and there's really kind of two engines to this. It's about sort of driving subscriber growth and building upon sort of the subscription revenues in these markets, but also making sure that we start to light up the advertising side in these markets as well, both of which basically ultimately help us clear these hurdles in fixed minimum payouts. So I think the story is one of ever constant progress in this department.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. We've got another question from Doug Anmuth on podcasting. With most major podcast content renewals resolved, what are your key priorities for the podcast business in 2024?Daniel G. EkYes. Much more of a continuation of 2023 with the exception, obviously, as you said, we've kind of transitioned the podcasting business from one structure to a different structure throughout 2023, that's mostly done. Now it's back to innovation and growth again. What I'm most excited about is there are lots of things that creators are asking us to do that enables them to easier post content, have more ways of engaging with their audience. You've seen some of this already in ['22 and '23]. As a reminder, you saw video podcasting growing in a healthy way on the platform. You've seen us add Q&A responses, which is quite phenomenal to see the comments that are showing up on Spotify. Now you've seen much more interactivity and more and more creators are starting to use those tools, but that's just the beginning. We have plenty of plans on podcasting, which I think will mean more content on the platform, which I also think means more engagement. So it has been a profitability story in 2023. And I think that's going to play out. But where we're focused on is really all about now growing podcasting and increasing it. And we think it's a lot larger of a medium than most people really today give it credit for. That's not where we need to prove. But we are doing so from a profitable standpoint instead of one that's losing a lot of money for us.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. We've got a question from Rich Greenfield on user engagement. Daniel, you've talked about user interest in your [Hack day] creation day list, which feels like another [AIML] use case to drive engagement. How is it impacting overall usage and time spent? And by the way, my day list for today is [Sad Tailspin Tuesday].Daniel G. EkAll right. Well, hopefully, nothing we're seeing on this call today gives you any reason to tail spin on a sad basis. But jokes aside, yes, I mean this, again, is a story of innovation at Spotify. What's so cool is we have these crazy engineers and scientists inside of the company that dreams up these kind of weird and wonderful things, which seems like very narrow use cases, but this is culture. And what they do is they test culture and they bring it out and they personalize culture to people. And it turns out that people are just reacting in this weird and wonderful way, and they want to express their own identity through music, which in itself is not surprising. It's a very core thing for humanity and something that we've been doing. And the team keeps finding weird and wonderful ways for consumers to be able to do that. And I think I referenced this, but we saw searches increased by over 2,000% on a day list. So it's a widely sought after feature people are excited to come into the app every day now to find out whatever Spotify thinks your current mood is of today. And yes, we keep churning these types of things out. It's kind of our way of creating content. And I'm really proud of the team and the things that they're doing in this department and it wouldn't surprise me if we see many more innovative things come out of it, both on -- of course, on the music side, but later on also reflecting that on the audio book side and the podcasting side as well.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. Our next question is going to come from Benjamin Black on efficiency. What are some of the key learnings you've seen with the more streamlined cost structure? And as we look ahead, what's your philosophy on headcount growth?Daniel G. EkYes. I mean the key things are probably not the surprising things. It's always what happens, right? Initially, when you go through an exercise, everyone kind of says, well, we can't cut this because then all of a sudden, everything will stop working. And it turns out that -- as this is true in so many cases, most things can tend to work anyway even when you go through that exercise, and it actually even killing things that sometimes sort of works is a healthy thing to refocus and reenergize people on the things that really drive lots of value. So those are some of the obvious lessons, which I think you guys have heard plenty of times before on these calls before. I think the more exciting things are the things we're in the midst of learning this as a company. So by no way it means things we're fully adapted to this mindset. But I think, this is something I wrote in my internal memo that we then published as well is, is this notion of being relentlessly resourceful. For me, that means to think constantly about the resources we're having and not just think about getting more of them, but thinking about how we reallocate constantly everything we're doing to the most and highest impact use case. And there, I don't think we are yet. So I think the good news is that there is still some ways for us to go on it. And I think the way you should think about headcount growth is, we're not allergic to it. We're not saying, hey, we can never ever grow anything. We should grow things that obviously are working, but the hurdle rate for any new type of investments will be much higher than what it has been and more importantly, I think you're going to see us more diligent in shutting down things that perhaps have sort of worked but may not work as well going forward into the future. And you're going to see that all across the company in a pretty big way. And I think the biggest takeaway I can give to you, that doesn't mean that the company is any danger of any kind because sometimes that get interpreted by media and investor, if they're no longer showing up in a big way to event X, maybe they're in dire straits and so on. That's not the case. We're just simply thinking about, are there better ways for us to do this? Are there better ways for us to achieve this efficiency and try to think outside of the box. Maybe it is not to throw the lavish party. Maybe it is to have a virtual party where we could have 10x the audience come and show up. Maybe it is about partnering with other brands and doing something in conjunction that where 1 plus 1 doesn't equal 2, but equals 3 or more. So you're going to see us, I think, still have a lot to learn, but re-question things that in the past have worked, but we need to think about how we do them going forward.Bryan Daniel GoldbergAll right. We've got time for a few more questions. Our next one is going to come from Steven Cahall on margins. First quarter is typically the lower margin quarter of the year. Are there any onetime benefits in the strong implied Q1 margin guidance? Or can we assume the same seasonality of sequentially improving margins for 2024?Paul Aaron VogelThanks, Steven. I think you have sort of the right themes in your question there. I think to reiterate, as Daniel said, in 2023, we had a lot of focus areas between sort of growing our users and subs, driving sort of monetization to price increases and efficiency actions, all these has sort of taken our core business, I think, to a new stair step. And I think Q1 is sort of where that new core business is shining through. And so I think that implies sort of like a new starting point, I think, for where you can expect the margin to go. And as I said before, our focus is to continue building on that sequentially quarter-on-quarter into 2024. So we look forward to making progress in that department.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. We've got question from Richard Kramer on execution. What's the message to the organization about new growth initiatives following your recent headcount reduction? How do you mitigate the execution risk in 2024?Daniel G. EkYes. I think implied in your question, Richard, is obviously this, how do you do both? How do you, on the one hand, save? And how do you tell people that you want to grow? And I think this is why in my last response, I focus so much about the mindset of being relentlessly resourceful and what it actually means. So I don't think it is either or I think it's both. And so I think we need to become more efficient by deprioritizing some of the existing things, but we also need to invest in some of the new. But when we're investing in some of the new, what is the optimal way of doing that? You talk about execution risk. I think it is exactly the right thing and right framing of it. It is about execution. It isn't about strategy. It's about how do we -- [buy] constraining the resources we have, how do we think about different ways to executing some of these newer growth initiatives? If the hurdle rate is X, how can we more quickly prove out that something is working? Those are some of the questions that I, Ben, Paul and the rest of the team is having when we're looking at these types of things and when we're talking to the teams. And I think the good news is that the teams are excited. They're excited to show that there's a different path to do this. They're excited because they also see the momentum in how it currently translates to the business and that sort of momentum fuels that mindset as well. I think it would have been honestly harder to do so from a backdrop if we had to do some of these discussions if we had 1 year, 1.5 years of slog just ever sort of going through this. But we've actually gone through all the hard stuff this past year. And we have plenty of things to learn, of course, but I feel really good about now. The optimism that the team has never fun to do a riff of course. And so we're happy to have this behind us, and we feel obviously a huge sense of gratitude to everyone who has been part of the company and then had to leave. But I know the team is excited about where we are and where we're heading and how it's translated into a healthier Spotify.Bryan Daniel GoldbergAll right. We're going to take one last question, and we're going to take Maria's question, Maria Ripps on podcasting. Is it reasonable to assume that Spotify is looking to structure most of its podcast deals in a similar fashion to what was reported in the Wall Street Journal regarding Joe Rogan? And how is the company thinking about the trade-off between engagement and advertising revenue or profitability by deemphasizing exclusivity?Daniel G. EkYes. I think, Maria, I sort of already mentioned some of these things. But -- generally speaking, we had multiple strategies in podcasting. It wasn't just all about exclusivities even if that got most of the -- sort of press headlines. And what we've been able to see here is as we've been learning over these past few years, is that while some of these exclusivity deals worked, generally, it wasn't aligned with what the creator wanted. The creator wants to have broader audience. And I feel like with these new deals that we've been making for most of 2023, we are in a position where we're actually better aligned with the creator. We can both deliver the growth rate, and we are equally incentivized to drive audience growth and, of course, then also drive revenue growth because we both share in that upside. So I think the team was able to innovate and create a much smaller structure and that is the path we see going forward on more and more of our deals and I think even on the MAU side, it will be on a healthy basis because we're in a very different position than we were just a few years ago in podcasting because today, Spotify is, in many cases, the #1 podcasting player already. So exclusivity makes sense when you're the smaller playing trying to gain scale. When you're the bigger player, the additional value of the exclusivity is far smaller than it is about being aligned. And it feels also that from a value's point of view, this is better aligned with who we are at Spotify, too.Bryan Daniel GoldbergGreat. Thanks, Maria, and thanks, everyone, for your questions. That's going to conclude our question-and-answer session today, and I'd like to turn it back over to Daniel for some closing remarks.Daniel G. EkYes. Thanks, Bryan. The long-term opportunity for Spotify is strong. Hopefully, you heard that now during the call and during the Q&A session. And we will continue to innovate in big and small ways to deliver for our listeners and the artists, creators and authors on our platform and make no mistake that we will continue to make bold bets, invest and seize on the opportunities when they make sense. But hopefully, it's clear now with much more disciplined approach going forward. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.Bryan Daniel GoldbergOkay. Great. And that concludes today's call. A replay will be available on our website and also on the Spotify app under Spotify earnings call replays. Thanks, everyone, for joining.OperatorThis concludes Spotify's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\"],\n",

       "  'In this article, we look at the 15 most powerful Asian countries in 2024. You can skip our detailed analysis on the economic potential and race for power in the world’s largest continent by heading over to the 5 Most Powerful Asian Countries in 2024.Western observers have been talking about Asia’s future potential for quite some time, and that future is catching up faster than expected. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, Asia, which in the year 2000 accounted for less than one-third of the world’s GDP in purchasing power parity terms, is poised to make up more than 50% of the global economy by 2040. In addition to this, Asia will also account for about 40% of the world’s consumption by then.PricewaterhouseCoopers has forecast that China alone would constitute 20% of the world’s GDP by 2050, while India will surpass the United States to become the second largest economy in the world, with Indonesia being fourth biggest economic power. All of these projections reiterate what many experts have long been saying, that this is going to be Asia’s century.\\xa0Over the last decade or so, several large corporations including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have outsourced some of their operations to Asian countries, for reasons ranging from cheap skillful labor to the lucrative opportunities offered by the huge market size in the continent.Today, 95% of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iPhone, iPads, and MacBooks are made in China – the country which also happened to be the source of 20% of the company’s overall revenue in 2022. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also making inroads in the Indian market. Its first retail store in the country was inaugurated last year in Mumbai.There has been an uptick in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s investments in Asia as well. In 2021, the company announced to set up a new data center in Indonesia, which is expected to increase revenues for the tech giant by $6.3 billion. Moreover, the International Data Corporation (IDC) has noted that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is likely to add to $39 billion and create 100,000 new jobs in the UAE’s economy between 2022 and 2026 through its cloud based services.Asian corporations themselves contribute about $19 trillion to the world economy each year, according to a report. The continent is home to some of the largest corporations in the world, like Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), TATA Group, and Reliance Industries, among others.The Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) holds a 12% share of the world’s automobile industry. 11.2 million vehicles were sold by the company in 2023, which secured Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)’s status as the top automaker for the fourth successive year. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the largest producer of semiconductors in the world, holding a 60% share of the global market. In 2023, it even beat the likes of Intel and Samsung in revenue, according to a report.Several economic powerhouses in Asia have begun leveraging their financial strength to enhance their military capabilities. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), about 25% of the world’s military expenditure of $2.2 trillion in 2022 was incurred by Asian countries.Defense expenditure has spiked 45% in the continent over the past decade, with the steepest rise seen in South Asia (46%) and East Asia (50%) – the two major flashpoints in the region. The threat of China invading Taiwan is higher today than it has ever been. The US has been ramping up its presence in the Indo-Pacific, and has approved sales of weapons worth billions to Taipei lately.Last year in March, Washington approved the sale of weapons worth $619 million for Taiwan, including 100 AGM-88B HARM and 200 AMRAAM missiles for its F-16 fleet. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are the primary contractors of the deal. South Korea is also set to receive up to 25 F-35 fighter jets developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) from the US for a deal worth $5 billion, amid increasing aggression from Pyongyang and Beijing.Oil-rich countries in the Middle East are also racking up their defense capabilities. The trend has picked up pace especially after the Arab Spring of 2010 that rattled several Arab monarchies. Saudi Arabia for instance has become the fifth largest spender on defense, having incurred over $75 billion in 2022, which included a $3 billion agreement with RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to acquire 300 MIM-104E Patriot missiles.American defense contractors are also expanding their presence in the Middle East, as part of the strategic ties between the US and its Arab allies. Earlier this week, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that it had signed agreements with Saudi firms to manufacture parts of its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system in the kingdom.Four weighted metrics have been considered to rank the most powerful Asian countries in 2024. These are economic strength (40%), military strength (35%), political power (15%), and cultural influence (10%). We observed where every Asian country ranked on each metric in the region and then assigned them weighted scores for those metrics. Finally, these scores were aggregated to have an overall score. Countries in this article are listed in descending order of their overall scores.Data on military strength has been sourced from our recent article, 24 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2024. To determine economic rank, we referred to IMF’s figures on nominal GDP for 2023. Brand Finance’s Global Soft Power Index 2023 was consulted for political soft power of countries, while we used CEO World’s rankings for cultural influence.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.Let’s now head over to the list of the most powerful countries in Asia.Economic Strength Rank: 18Military Strength Rank: 7Political Power Rank: 19Cultural Influence Rank: 27Weighted-Average Ranking: 3.80Despite ranking low on political soft power and cultural influence, Pakistan is one of the most powerful countries in Asia.

       "  'Spotify CEO Daniel Ek ratcheted up his yearslong fight with Apple over its app store policies by accusing the company of skirting new EU requirements to fix the problem.Ek had successfully pushed Europe’s antitrust regulators to require that Apple let users download iOS apps from third party app stores. But on Tuesday, he complained that Apple’s subsequent changes are “a farce” that continues to harm app developers.“Apple’s stance is very much incongruent to our stance on the matter, and frankly, I think it’s a bit of a farce,” Ek said during Spotify’s earnings call on Tuesday.To comply with the EU’s new rules, Apple recently introduced new terms for app purchases and downloads. While Apple is reducing its commission fee for in-app transactions—from 30% to 17%, or 10% for small businesses—it is tacking on additional charges. Developers who use the App Store’s payment processing system will have to pay a 3% fee, and large developers will have to pay €0.50 ($0.54) every time a user downloads their app from an alternative app store.This leaves music streaming giant Spotify in the same or a worse position than under Apple’s old policy of charging developers a 30% commission on in-app purchases, Spotify said. App developers can choose whether they want to operate under the old rules or switch to the new ones, but those who adopt the new terms can never switch back.“It looks on the surface like they’re complying with it,” Ek said during the call about Apple complying with the new EU regulations. “But behind the surface, they’re doing pretty much everything to make this such an unattractive experience that no sane developer would want to pick the new terms.”Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Apple’s policy changes and the new regulation, called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), go into effect in March. During Apple’s earnings call last week, CEO Tim Cook said predicting how consumers will react to the change is difficult, and that it’s too early to know how the changes will impact the company’s revenue. While Spotify says Apple’s new policies circumvent the new rules, the European Commission will ultimately decide on the matter.At the core of this feud is Spotify’s bottom line. Over the past four quarters, it has reported a profit only once. Ek protested that some of his company’s ideas to generate more revenue, like selling individual audiobooks, are undermined by Apple’s excessive fees.“Apple insists on taking a 30% cut, which in many cases exceeds even our own cut,” he said, adding that it limits “some of these innovative things we would like to do.”The good news for Spotify investors is that Apple’s policy changes result in no downside for Spotify’s existing business, Ek said. Spotify can continue to operate under Apple’s old terms. If the European Commission strictly enforces the DMA against Apple, though, the “potential upsides could be quite significant,” he said.For the most recent quarter, which ended Dec. 31, Spotify reported subscriber growth that beat analysts’ expectations and revenue that fell slightly below. The company had 236 million paid subscribers, up 10 million from the previous quarter. Meanwhile, it generated $3.67 billion in revenue, or 16% year-over-year growth.Investors cheered the news Tuesday morning, sending the stock soaring 9% before it retreated to a 4% gain, at $231.92.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com'],\n",

       "  \"As you might know, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently reported its quarterly numbers. The result was positive overall - although revenues of US$120b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Apple surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$2.18 per share, modestly greater than expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. Check out our latest analysis for Apple Following last week's earnings report, Apple's 43 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$388.3b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory per share are forecast to be US$6.55, approximately in line with the last 12 months. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$396.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.57 in 2024. The consensus seems maybe a little more pessimistic, trimming their revenue forecasts after the latest results even though there was no change to its EPS estimates.The consensus has reconfirmed its price target of US$200, showing that the analysts don't expect weaker revenue expectations next year to have a material impact on Apple's market value. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Apple, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$250 and the most bearish at US$125 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that Apple's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 0.9% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 10% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 4.7% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Apple is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Unfortunately, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates underperformance compared to the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. Even so, earnings are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. The consensus price target held steady at US$200, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

You\\'re listening to Motley Fool Money. I\\'m Ricky Mulvey, joined today by Jim Gillies. Jim, good to see you.Jim Gillies: It\\'s great to be seen. Thanks, Ricky.Ricky Mulvey: Big tech earnings, they\\'re kicking off this week. The show is going out, as Microsoft and Alphabet report, excuse us for our timeliness. Jim, I know you\\'re not a tech investor, and I\\'m baiting you with that. Is there anything you\\'re keeping an eye on from the mega caps?Jim Gillies: I am a tech investor when it makes sense for me to be a tech investor. We\\'ll put it that way. You can feel free to ask me about my cost basis in Amazon, Apple, Shopify, MercadoLibre, and I\\'ll leave it at that. Or what I did with Apple in late of 2018, 2019 when you were buying the premier cash-generating story of our generation for 10 times cash flow. But anyway, what am I looking forward for out of big tech. Basically, I just think it\\'s largely going to be more of the same. I think Amazon looks like they probably have some pop in them coming out. Microsoft will probably continue their excellence. I know there\\'s some questions about Apple, specific valuation wise, in context of, shall we say, growth dearth. More recently, valuation ratios have been elevated versus the growth profile. I\\'m interested to see that, interested to see the product lines at Apple. How they do in terms of phones, how they do in terms of watch. We forget about the iPad and then also in terms of their services. Microsoft, like I said, is probably just going to continue to being excellent. At Alphabet, there\\'s some question about advertising spend as well as, there\\'s the will they are, won\\'t they? Antitrust stuff that seems to always be circling around. But largely, these are for the most part strong, excellent companies, and we\\'ll probably just see more of the same. I don\\'t think anyone\\'s opinion is going to be changed by any of the earnings reports from the so-called Magnificent Seven.Ricky Mulvey: I will ask you about your cost basis in those companies. If you ask me about my cost basis in Unity Software and Lemonade, and the listeners will find out why I am hosting this show and you are offering analysis on various companies.Jim Gillies: Fair enough.Ricky Mulvey: I\\'ll tell you one piece of information that affected my thinking a little bit. It was Bill Mann on the Friday show. He made a great point about just how large these companies are. Microsoft is at the point where its market cap is worth $428 for every single person on the planet. The Magnificent Seven is now about 30% of the US stock market. For the people who aren\\'t thinking about it, what does this mean for the average investor or, how about the people who like to pick stocks?Jim Gillies: I mean, can open worms everywhere, right?Ricky Mulvey: Yeah.Jim Gillies: I got some fun little data that I\\'ve looked up here and been playing with. You mentioned Microsoft, and the size. Here is something more, most people know. I\\'m Canadian, I live just outside of Toronto. The 394 largest Canadian companies, publicly traded companies in Canada, combined have a market value of approximately 2.7 trillion. Microsoft is slightly over 3 trillion. Again, this truly is pretty insane in terms of size and scale wise. For people who like to pick stocks, honestly, I think you stay away from the Magnificent Seven. That\\'s going to sound a little, maybe, crazy. I mean, a lot of people are loving the story, specifically about Nvidia. Apples moved a little bit past their prime by some people. But you can get all the Magnificent Seven exposure you want and then some by just buying a simple S&P 500 ETF. I\\'m someone that likes a portion of my portfolio and index funds because sometimes my style, which I\\'m very comfortable with, but sometimes my style, any style, is out of favor. I have a significant part of my family\\'s personal wealth in S&P 500 index funds, TSX Index fund, and that thing. But I actually have a case study for you, Ricky. I came today with a case study because, here in Canada or as I like to refer to it, Soviet Kanakistan, we had the largest company by market cap, which was a company called Nortel Networks. In the summer of 2000, Nortel hit its all-time high price, such that its market cap was something like $380 billion Canadian. To put that into perspective today, nearly a quarter Century later, the largest company in Canada, by market cap is the Royal Bank of Canada at 187 billion. Here was good old Nortel networks at 2X, today\\'s largest company. Nortel has this really interesting factoid about it that it was once the largest company in Canada, and it is a zero today. The danger, if you will, or air quotes, danger of investing in an S&P 500 index fund is you are basically putting 1/3, 30% of your money into the Magnificent Seven, effectively. We have an example of a company being 1/3 of the index, roughly Nortel Networks in Canada in the early 2000s, going to zero and the impact on index investors.Essentially, I looked up some data, the TSX, from the start of the data set that I have, which is late 1979 up to Nortel\\'s all-time high in July of 2000, the TSX had returned an annualized 12.6% total return, dividends included. That\\'s pretty good, 21 years, 12.6% annualized. Since then, it has returned about 8% total because it had to absorb the largest company in the index, almost 1/3 of the index going to zero. Now, that\\'s not going to happen with the Magnificent Seven. But you can see how index investors who are going to hold a lot of the Magnificent Seven stocks because again, it\\'s about 30% of the index. Index investors have a large exposure here. If the magnificent seven do take a breather, because a couple of them are, we\\'ll just say richly valued. Shall I leave it at that. Or if there\\'s any kind of stumble that causes a revaluation for one or more of them, they could lead to stalling out of index appreciation in the US or S&P 500 which then could have an impact on the long term returns for investors, specifically index investors. Again, TSX Pre Nortel 12.5%-12.6% an annual lies from 1979 to Nortel\\'s peak. Following Nortel\\'s peak, about 8%. There is the potential for some muted gains if these stocks do stumble.Ricky Mulvey: I want to move on to the Flutter listing in a sec. I will plug that. I think you have a great, great thread or post on X about index investing and essentially the returns and costs associated with index investing versus the famous active investors including Kathy Wood and Bill Ackman. I\\'ll put a link in the show notes.Jim Gillies: Sure.Ricky Mulvey: There is a gambling company called Flutter. It is making headlines. It\\'s an international sports betting company known in the US for Fan Duel, and it joined the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. The shares listed in London pop 20%. We\\'ll talk about the business in a sec, but it seems like a really big deal to join the New York Stock Exchange even in 2024.Jim Gillies: Is it?Ricky Mulvey: It is, not to you.Jim Gillies: Not to me at all. No, I don\\'t know why. For an already publicly listed company to pop 20%, I view dual listings or even triple listings. I could give you a couple tickers that are on multiple exchanges, not just two. It\\'s almost like stock splits. I\\'ve got one pizza. Whether I cut it into two pieces, four pieces or eight pieces, I still have one pizza. This is the same company, like you did not create 20% more economic value by just dual listing this thing. I think some of those people who are buying those shares to pop at 20% may have gotten over their skis a little bit, but that\\'s their problem, not mine.Ricky Mulvey: I\\'m hoping I can bait you a little bit with the value of the story with this company. Stock has solidly beaten the market. It\\'s a highly addictive product, looking to put a casino in every pocket and be climate-neutral along the way. Jim is shaking your head for those listening at home and I want you to tell me if I\\'m an old codger on this one. The company is still very much in growth mode. It has incredible revenue growth numbers of I think something like 70% year over year in the United States. Forty percent total for the company. It issues a lot of debt. It also issues a lot of shares. I think it\\'s about 4x its shares outstanding since 2016. At the same time, it\\'s had trouble growing its earnings per share. I mean, what is the market thinking about this company? It\\'s been a market beater, but the earnings per share necessarily haven\\'t really grown.Jim Gillies: Well, if you\\'re an old codger, what am I? I\\'m old enough to remember the first round of publicly traded companies trying to bring people into the internet gambling space and how basically the morality police basically shut them down and destroyed all the value that was building up companies like cryptologic, companies like Boss Media. It\\'s interesting to me that 15, almost 18 years later, I guess the morality police have decided better off to join them rather than trying to put them out of business. I like the story here in terms of their brands. I mean, even I\\'ve heard of fan duel. I\\'m not someone who does a lot of gambling, frankly because, well, because I can do math. They do have recognizable brand that\\'s important in a space which is essentially commodity space. Then in terms of revenue growth, Yeah. I mean, if you\\'ve grown your share count 4x over the past 7.5 years, yes, of course, this is going to impinge your earnings-per-share growth or anything per share growth. My question, not really knowing this company beyond the branding; my question is what have they spent those shares on? Because in very classic Berkshire Hathaway acquisition mode, if they\\'ve spent those shares as part of acquisitions where they have perhaps, taken on more value than they\\'ve given up in the form of those shares. That can actually be very good, and I\\'ve got no problem with that dilution if they\\'ve been hosing it to insiders. It\\'d be very hard, I think, to 4x share count and only give it to insiders. I suspect there\\'s been some acquisition stuff going there. But just giving it to. It\\'d be a little difficult, a little bit more difficult to love that. But no, I think it\\'s interesting some of the brands that they have, some of the brands that they hold, Betfair and Poker Stars were brands that I saw in that first iteration of the online gaming public thing. I think I can make a case for liking the one.Ricky Mulvey: In other businesses you have switching costs. In this one there are switching incentives that you might want to look at. Another thing with the business that I think is worth looking at is that it has about $6,000,000,000 in net debt. The reason it says 4.7 on cap IQ, I think is because it\\'s listed in British Pounds. The interest costs about 150 million for the first half of 2023. It\\'s got the adjusted free cash flow to cover it, but some of that debt is not investment grade and it\\'s got a pretty high debt load for a company. Is this a risk that its investors should be paying attention to?Jim Gillies: One hundred percent, but you should always pay attention. That\\'s a layout because you should always pay attention. Any company that\\'s got some debt, you want to see the tenor of the debt, you want to see what\\'s the interest rate, what\\'s the maturity schedule. I\\'m not too sure what adjusted free cash flow is, to be honest with you. I\\'m old school where I like cash flow from operations minus PX is my starting point. When we do that, cash flow from operations should include the cash interest on it, but it is something to pay attention to. If this company is suffering from easy switching, we\\'ll put it that way. They might get stuck in that pattern where they have to always provide incentives. It\\'s like to throw back the Bed Bath and Beyond when they were still alive. They gave you a coupon every week in your mail of 2 so no one went in without a coupon. This whole industry space may have evolved to a spot where they have to give you constant incentives because there is essentially no cost of switching. But I would always pay attention to the debt load because, yeah, that\\'s financial risk. Financial risk is the thing.Ricky Mulvey: Jim Gillies, thank you for your time and your insight.Jim Gillies: Thank you.Ricky Mulvey: Before the next segment going to do a quick ad.

I will also include a link in the show notes. Last week Robert Brokamp kicked off a conversation with Michael Finke, a professor of wealth management and the director for the Granham Center for Financial Security at the American College of Financial Services. Up next is part two of that conversation where they discuss the three ingredients of a happy retirement.Robert Brokamp: To a certain degree, we\\'re having this discussion because in America, everyone has to be their own financial planner and investment manager. At least to some degree, especially now that fewer people are being covered by traditional pensions. This also means that we could be managing our own finances well into our \\'80s and \\'90s. What does your research show about financial literacy and how it\\'s affected by getting older?Michael Finke: Financial decision making ability is very similar to driving ability. With the ability to drive, we lose about one to 2% of our capabilities every year. There\\'s a problem with that. One of the problems is that we\\'re a lot worse at it in our \\'90s than we were in our \\'60s. The other problem is that it\\'s happened so gradually that we oftentimes don\\'t perceive it. We\\'ve all had this experience of driving with a relative who may be in their late \\'80s or \\'90s. We\\'re sitting there in the passenger seat. After a block, we realize that we\\'re in the wrong seat. This is not someone who should be piloting around at 2.5 ton vehicle. We\\'re all piloting our own 2.5 ton vehicle when it comes to our retirement savings in our \\'90s, if we don\\'t create some sort of a plan for dealing with this inevitable cognitive decline. It\\'s just a part of getting older. It happens on all of these cognitive tasks. We lose our ability to, and it\\'s not an easy thing to do to manage an investment portfolio and decide how much we can safely take out every year. I think part of the retirement planning is recognizing that that\\'s going to happen to us. To the extent that we can delegate some of that decision making to someone who is legally required to look out for our best interest or automating income, especially later on in life.Makes a lot of sense. I\\'m a huge fan by the way of the criminally under utilized Qualified Longevity annuity contract, which is a way to take up to $200,000 of your IRA savings and buy yourself an income. By the way, the rates are really attractive right now, so the quotes are pretty good. Buy yourself an income that starts at the age of 85, then you don\\'t have to worry so much about what\\'s going on in the market before the age of 85, and it\\'s like dementia insurance. You\\'re going to get that income and there\\'s a tax incentive to do so because you don\\'t have to pay any RMDs on that $200,000. I am a card carrying member of the QLAC Appreciation Society. There are at least ten of us now. I encourage anybody to join. It\\'s one of those things that economists love, this idea of being able to buy longevity insurance, but it doesn\\'t sound at all appealing to the average person. I put up $200,000 and I only get it back. I only get to spend any of it. If I live to the age of 85. Now, I may get an income of $80,000 a year for the rest of my life. That\\'s pretty cool, but I only get it if I live past the age of 85. Now practically speaking, it makes retirement income planning a lot easier to delegate that longevity risk to an institution, like an insurance company. Take it off your plate and then also automate later life income.Robert Brokamp: A follow up point to that. The evidence is clear that retirees with higher levels of guaranteed income tend to be happier in retirement. You did a study with David Blanchet, which I think you called it \"License to Spend\". Whereas people who had more guaranteed income felt more comfortable spending money because they didn\\'t feel like they had to play it safe because they were worried about outliving their money. I think you agree that with most people that the best annuity is delaying Social Security to age 70. In one study you did showed it\\'s even more beneficial for women.Michael Finke: Yes, because women live longer. The best way to think about delaying Social Security is that you are buying an inflation adjusted annuity which really doesn\\'t exist anywhere outside of Social Security. That\\'s what you\\'re doing. You\\'re taking some of your savings. You can use it as a bridge strategy. Let\\'s say that I\\'m 65 when I retire. I want to think about potentially delaying Social Security to 70. Take money out of my IRA, use it to fund my lifestyle for five years. Then at 70, I get a much larger Social Security income payment. It\\'s adjusted for inflation. It\\'s a significant amount of income for a high earner. For many retirees, it\\'s pretty close to enough to cover all of their basic expenses. Then you use your savings for the remainder. The reason why it\\'s so attractive is because some of the rules that define how much extra income you get for delayed claiming, those were created in the early 1980s based on mortality tables in the early 1980s and assumptions of after inflation interest rates in the early 1980s. They\\'ve changed since the early 1980s, which means that delaying Social Security is more attractive now. In fact, it\\'s a way of gaming the system. You get to buy something at a below market price or buying an inflation protected annuity at a below market price, if you use your IRA savings to delay claiming. Remember it is most valuable in the year after the adjustment goes up. It goes from 5% per year to 6 and 2/3%. That\\'ll happen for someone born after 1960 at age 65. If you wait between 65 and 66. If you wait between 67 and 68 again, you get that 8% increase in lifetime income. It should be just a little bit higher every year, but the government uses a short cut. They make it 5% for a couple of years, 6 and 2/3% for a couple of years,8% for three years. That is a shortcut and it makes it most valuable to delay claiming the first year that that rate goes up.Robert Brokamp: When you were talking about what to do with concerns about cognitive decline, you also talked about maybe hiring somebody who has a responsibility to keep an eye on your money. You did a study on financial advice and whether outcomes were better or not. It looked like it depended somewhat on the incentives of the financial advisor.Michael Finke: Well, right. If incentives run in many different directions and they\\'re highly complex. When it comes to someone who is legally required to look out for your best interest, they\\'re going to be less likely to sell you, for example, a product that maximizes the amount of commissions that they can get. That becomes especially a problem for older consumers. But at the same time, you may not need someone to manage your money every year. Someone who is paid a fee has a strong incentive not to discourage you from. They don\\'t necessarily benefit if you\\'re spending down your savings over time. That\\'s a conflict of interest. Also in retirement, there\\'s the only types of advisors where you just pay a fee for a financial plan that tends to minimize those types of conflicts. But every form of compensation involves a certain type of conflict of interest. I think it\\'s just important to be aware of them. You really want someone that you can trust. You want someone who has figured out some succession plan. Because if you hire them when you\\'re 65, you want to be able to rely on them when you\\'re 95 also. You want to feel confident. This is something I think it\\'s easier to assess in your 60s than it is in your 90s. You want to feel confident that they\\'re going to be making recommendations that are in your best interest. Oftentimes, it\\'s not easy because you may, in your 90s be tempted to make choices that are necessarily not in your best interest. It may be important to have an advisor that can help guide you through some of those complex choices to make sure that you don\\'t make mistakes.Robert Brokamp: Let\\'s move on to our last couple of questions here. You\\'ve done a lot of research not only on how to retire, but how to retire well. What have you found to be the ingredients of a happy retirement?Michael Finke: When I run an analysis on retirement satisfaction. What I find is that the predictors cluster into three groups. Well, first of all, money, so it\\'s good to have more money. Second of all relationships, so positive relationships, particularly the most important relationship that we have in retirement is with our primary partner, generally our spouse, friends also matter. Kids not so much. The relationship we have with our kids is not a significant predictor of life satisfaction. But the relations we have with our friends are. Friendships are an investment also, they are investments just like health or money. We can during our pre retirement years maintain those friendships as a way of cashing in or making sure that we cash in on them after retirement because they are a source of life satisfaction. Of course, the third one is health, and it is important to think of health as an investment. I just read Peter Attia\\'s book, Outlive, and one of the things that really struck me about that book was this idea that our ability to process oxygen VO_2 max goes down every decade in life. You have to work to maintain your VO_2 max. When it comes to retirement planning, that\\'s an important thing to remember because let\\'s say you want to go hiking after you retire. You\\'ve always wanted to go hiking in Switzerland and Colorado, and so you saved up this money so that you can go on vacations and then you get there and your VO_2 max isn\\'t good enough to go hiking. You\\'ve got to be able to not just save for the vacation, you also have to be able to make investments in your health so that you can combine. Because remember, the money doesn\\'t provide any happiness on its own. It\\'s an input into the production of happiness when you combine it with other stuff like relationships, like health. Remember money is just green paper. It\\'s just dots on a computer screen. It\\'s the other stuff that you can make an investment in, that actually produces the life satisfaction.Robert Brokamp: Let\\'s wrap things up with our final question. Is there anything else about retirement planning that you think is underappreciated, but more people should know about?Michael Finke: I think friendships are the one that really, I did not fully appreciate when I started doing research in this area. It defines where you want to live when you retire. Do you want to move to the beach? Do you want to move to the mountains? Well, if you have friendships that are really that strong source of life satisfaction, the weather is less important than the activities that you\\'re doing in retirement. I think the one thing that I did not fully appreciate is to be more, I guess, thoughtful about planning how I\\'m actually going to live. I think a lot of us who are very quant focused, just think if we have enough money saved, we\\'ve got it figured out. But money again, money is not what makes us happy. It is our ability to imagine what we\\'re actually going to do, and then making investments and putting together a plan that is most likely to result in a satisfying retirement. That\\'s something I think a lot of people just haven\\'t thought enough about. Have you actually sat down and imagined how you\\'re going to spend your time, where you\\'re going to live, who you\\'re going to be interacting with, because if you don\\'t do it, you\\'re going to find yourself a bit lost. I see this a lot among people who retire is, work gave me a lot of stuff. It gave me a lot of opportunities for social interaction. I felt a lot of accomplishment. I was able to do what I was good at. Then I retired without giving enough thought to actually how I was going to spend my time. That\\'s the thing that I think is under appreciated.Robert Brokamp: Well Michael, this has been as educational as expected.

       "  'Silicon Valley has been the unofficial mascot of tech behemoths for years. But perhaps ironically, two of the largest technology leaders for decades don\\'t directly hail from the Bay Area.Cupertino, California-based Apple is one of the most-recognized consumer electronics businesses of all time. From the iPod to the iPhone, Apple flourished under visionary leader Steve Jobs. Since 2011, the company has been led by Tim Cook. Under Cook\\'s reign, Apple\\'s market capitalization has increased nearly tenfold. At this writing, Apple\\'s market cap was about $2.9 trillion.But the company\\'s longtime rival, Seattle-based Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), has quietly caught up to Apple\\'s influence. For now, Microsoft is the most valuable company in the world -- worth over $3 trillion.I suspect Apple and Microsoft will go back and forth between the world\\'s largest enterprise for a bit. However, one of these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks is emerging as the clear winner. Let\\'s dig into how Microsoft reinvented itself, and more importantly, why the long-term picture looks better than ever.Apple has a long list of groundbreaking innovative products. The company revolutionized how music is consumed with the introduction of the iPod. Furthermore, both the MacBook and iPad disrupted the personal-computing (PC) market, giving creatives an entirely new way to produce content. And perhaps most importantly, the advent of the iPhone reinvented how people communicate on a daily basis.Therefore, it\\'s not surprising that the combination of such a deep and prolific portfolio of products helped Apple become the world\\'s first trillion-dollar company.On the other side of the equation is Microsoft. While the company is a pioneer for modern-day computing applications, Microsoft spent many years in Apple\\'s shadow. The company resorted to a host of acquisitions to drive growth and product innovation.But in 2014, Microsoft named Satya Nadella as its new CEO. Eerily similar to Cook, Nadella has helped propel Microsoft\\'s value by approximately tenfold over the last decade.How did Nadella inspire such robust growth in just 10 years? A close look at the executive\\'s background will shed some light on how he reinvented the Windows developer.Before taking over as CEO, Nadella led Microsoft\\'s cloud division. The company recently reported earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, ended Dec. 31. While total revenue increased 18% year over year to $62 billion, the cloud division was the big winner.One reason why the cloud is becoming increasingly important for Microsoft is its infusion of artificial intelligence (AI) features into the platform. Microsoft is a large investor in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. Over the last year, Microsoft swiftly integrated ChatGPT across its ecosystem -- a move that is already paying off in spades.During the earnings call, Nadella proclaimed, \"We\\'ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale.\"Given that Microsoft Cloud increased 24% year over year to $33.7 billion of revenue in the quarter, I\\'d say Nadella\\'s commentary is holding true. But although artificial intelligence (AI) carries some exciting prospects for Microsoft, investors should take a thorough look at the company\\'s valuation before pouring into the stock.As of the time of this writing, Microsoft trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 36 -- well above its 10-year average of 30. By comparison, cloud specialists Amazon and Alphabet trade at forward P/E multiples of 47 and 21, respectively.While Microsoft stock is right in the middle among its top competition, the stock isn\\'t exactly cheap. The forward P/E of the S&P 500 is about 22, considerably lower than Microsoft and its cohorts.I don\\'t think that the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) is fully baked into Microsoft stock. But this analysis illustrates that investors are placing a premium on the biggest names in AI.Despite its rich valuation, it is hard to pass up on Microsoft. The company is growing at an impressive rate, and its ambitions with AI are in very early stages. I think the company is well positioned for the long term, and the stock could very well be on its way to new highs. Now could be a good time to use dollar-cost averaging to initiate or add to a position in the stock.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

       "  'Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that missed expectations. But strong guidance helped boost shares in early trading as the music-streaming platform continues to focus on profitability amid recent price hikes and changes to its podcasting strategy.The company reported an operating loss of 75 million euros ($80.6 million) in the quarter amid severance and real estate-related charges. This was ahead of updated company guidance that Q4 operating losses would come in between 93 million euros and 108 million euros.The audio giant also guided to a strong Q1 operating income of 180 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Spotify reported an operating loss of 231 million euros in the year-ago period.On the earnings call, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek emphasized the company\\'s recent \"efficiency\" strategy.\"The hurdle rate for any new type of investments will be much higher than what it has been,\" he said, adding the company will be more diligent and disciplined in shutting down previous processes that no longer serve this new mandate.\"That doesn\\'t mean that the company is any danger of any kind,\" he said. \"We\\'re just simply thinking about, \\'Are there better ways for us to do this?\\'\"Shares climbed as much as 11% shortly after the opening bell.The streaming service reported a net loss of 70 million euros ($75.2 million), or a loss of 0.36 euros per share. That missed analyst expectations of a loss of 0.31 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 430 million euros, or a loss of 2.23 euros a share.The losses come after the company turned a profit in Q3 for the first time in over a year.Gross margins, however, came in stronger than expected at 26.7%, slightly beating company guidance of 26.6%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick down slightly to 26.4% in the first quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.Spotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business. With the exception of Q3, margins have been stuck between 21% and 25% in recent quarters.Revenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.67 billion euros — 16% higher compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, but slightly below Wall Street expectations of 3.72 billion euros. Spotify guided to first quarter revenue of 3.6 billion euros.Total monthly active users (MAUs) beat company estimates of 601 million to hit 602 million in the quarter — a 23% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q1 MAUs to come in at 618 million.Premium subscribers also surpassed Wall Street expectations of 224 million to hit 236 million — a 15% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 239 million in the first quarter. Q4 net additions of 10 million contributed to record full-year net additions of 31 million, the company said.Free cash flow, another key metric for investors, jumped on both a yearly and quarterly basis, coming in at 396 million euros compared to 216 million euros in the prior quarter and negative 73 million euros in the year-ago period.The average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 1% to 4.60 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.Overall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.Spotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.That spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone. The company also announced CFO Paul Vogel will step down from his position on March 31.In addition to layoffs, Spotify raised prices, changed its royalty structure, and made audiobooks free to paying subscribers.But more changes are expected as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.Late last week, Spotify announced a new deal with its most popular podcaster: Joe Rogan.The company revealed Rogan\\'s podcast, which was previously exclusive to Spotify, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years.The multiyear deal, which the Wall Street Journal pegged at $250 million, represents Spotify\\'s broader podcast distribution push, which it first began to roll out last year.Under the new agreement, Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan, meanwhile, will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.The company recently renegotiated a similar contract with Alexandra Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy.\"The podcast, which Spotify purchased for a reported $60 million in 2021, will now be available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast\\'s video portion.Spotify shares have surged about 80% over the past year and are up more than 15% year to date. The stock is still off about 40% from its record high of $364.59 a share in February 2021.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

       "  \"Earnings season has arrived, providing fresh batches of figures to consider when expanding your portfolio.Two of the major companies releasing results last week were Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Both have built immense brand loyalty with consumers and boast powerful positions in retail. Apple has almost unrivaled supremacy in consumer tech products. Amazon has similar dominance in e-commerce and the cloud market.Since 2019, Apple has soared by 349% and Amazon by 96%. While past growth is no guarantee of what's to come, these companies have solid long-term outlooks as they continue to expand in their respective industries. Meanwhile, Apple and Amazon both beat Wall Street forecasts for earnings per share\\xa0 and revenue in their most recent quarters.But is Apple or Amazon the better stock to buy right now?Apple is coming out of a tricky year. Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company in its fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept. 30, 2023), and revenue dipped by 3%. However, the results from its fiscal 2024 first quarter (which ended Dec. 31, 2023) showed signs that a recovery could be underway.During the quarter, Apple's net sales rose 2% year over year to $120 billion, beating analysts' expectations by more than $1 billion and breaking a streak of four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Meanwhile, its earnings hit $2.18 per share compared to an expected $2.10 per share.Yet, outperforming estimates wasn't enough to quell investor concern over its iPhone business. Smartphone sales increased 6% in Q1 2024, yet fell 13% in China. That country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening sales in one of Apple's most crucial markets. China accounts for about 17% of its product sales.As a result, Apple's stock fell nearly 4% in after-hours trading following its earnings release on Feb. 1.However, recent challenges are why keeping a long-term perspective with proven growth stocks like Apple is crucial. The company has a highly lucrative digital services business and is investing heavily in expanding markets like artificial intelligence (AI).Additionally, the tech firm hit nearly $100 billion in free cash flow last year. It has the funds to overcome current headwinds and continue investing in its business.Wall Street seemed to have the opposite reaction to Amazon's earnings release. The e-commerce giant's shares rose by nearly 10% after it posted its Q4 2023 results on Feb. 1.During the quarter, Amazon's revenue grew 14% year over year to $170 billion, outperforming the consensus forecast by close to $4 billion. Meanwhile, its earnings per share came to $1, compared to an expected $0.80.Much of Amazon's stellar growth came from its e-commerce business. Its North American segment posted operating income exceeding $6 billion, significantly improving on the $240 million in losses reported in the year-ago quarter.Amazon's Q4 was a fitting end to a stellar year of growth. After suffering steep declines in 2022 as spikes in inflation curbed consumer discretionary spending, the company pulled off an impressive turnaround.As a result, Amazon's stock is up 63% year over year, compared to a 28% rise in Apple's share price. During the same period, Amazon's free cash flow soared by 427% to $17 billion. Apple's total free cash flow is higher, but declined by just over 1% over the last 12 months.Amazon is on a promising growth trajectory, with solid retail growth and a highly profitable cloud business.Comparing these firms' forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/E), Apple's 28 against Amazon's 48 makes the iPhone company's stock look like a far better value. Forward P/E is a valuation metric calculated by dividing a company's share price by its estimated future earnings per share. The lower the figure, generally, the better the value.However, the chart below shows their valuations are more complex than that.This chart shows Apple's earnings could hit nearly $8 per share over the next two fiscal years, and Amazon's might reach just under $7 per share. Multiplying these figures by the companies' forward P/E ratios yields stock prices of $218 for Apple and $317 for Amazon.Based on their current positions, these projections would see Apple's stock price rise 17% by fiscal 2026, while Amazon shares would increase by 84%.As a result, Amazon's stock is a no-brainer in a decision between these two companies. The tech giant is on a growth path too good to ignore, making it the better stock to buy right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

       "  \"In this article, we will take a look at 20 Best Permanent Residency Countries in the World. You can skip our detailed analysis of permanent residency and go directly to the 5 Best Permanent Residency Countries in the World. This vast world is filled with places of wonderment. Many of us love to travel and experience the diversity in nature and culture that has spread out to nooks and corners around the globe. Additionally, there are those who choose to settle down permanently in a country other than their birthplace. In the latter case, the idea behind the visit is to simply explore new experiences and spend some vacation time in a pleasing manner. However, in the former, practicality takes precedence, and numerous variables are considered before a final decision is reached. The aim is to choose the best permanent-residency country in the world.According to the IOM UN Migration Report 2022, the majority of people worldwide still reside in their countries of origin. Only one in thirty individuals falls into the immigrant category. In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 281 million international migrants existed globally, constituting about 3.6% of the total world population. Notably, this figure marked an increase of 128 million people compared to the 1990 figure and was three times higher than the estimated figure for 1970. Thus, this indicates a burgeoning desire in people to move, sparking the search for the best country in the world to settle permanently.Permanent residency, often referred to as a PR visa, denotes a resident status in a country other than one's country of origin, granting individuals the right to live, work, study, and even establish a business in that country. Holders of a PR visa may also be entitled to social security, healthcare, and various financial benefits. Additionally, the visa may permit individuals to bring their families, including parents, and children may qualify for free schooling. It is important to note that these benefits can vary across countries. The residency permit, which is issued to legally ensure these activities, is usually renewed after a specific time period. During this time, individuals are free to enter or leave the country, but it's crucial to keep in mind that maintaining residency status typically requires a minimum physical presence.There are various types of permanent residency visas, including skilled immigration, state/territory/province-sponsored immigration, employer-based immigration, family migration, and investment migration. While certain general requirements apply to all PR visas, specific details can vary from country to country. In fact, some countries do not even permit permanent residency, and the necessary physical presence requirement also differs across nations. Hence, before uprooting one's life to move elsewhere, it's essential to ensure that the chosen destination is the best fit for permanent residency.Over the past decade, a significant number of individuals have been seeking settlement or acquiring second citizenship in European nations. This trend has been further fueled by European countries easing their immigration processes, largely in response to labor shortages within the union. However, it's noteworthy to highlight the permanent immigrant inflow figure of the United States for the year 2022, standing at 1.05 million--the highest compared to other countries. The U.S. has consistently ranked as the top country for accepting immigrants, with the 2021 figure reaching 833,900, as reported by US News. This trend is unsurprising, given the country's generous approach to immigration through various channels. One notable method is employer-based immigration, where companies sponsor employees for green cards. Tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE), among others, have actively sponsored their employees for green cards.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is an American multinational technology company that has employed a substantial number of overseas workers over the years. In the fiscal years 2020 to 2022 alone, the company submitted 13,381 labor condition applications for H-1B visas and 3,412 labor certifications for green cards. Notably, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently reached a $25 million settlement with the U.S. government concerning the hiring of immigrants.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), another American multinational technology company, has employed a significant number of foreign workers. From 2020 to 2022, the company submitted 26,695 labor condition applications for H-1B visas and 9,920 labor certifications for green cards. Barbara Leen, Senior Corporate Counselor at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), remains an advocate for immigrants, actively urging for reform in the U.S. immigration policy.Let’s take a look at our list of 20 Best Permanent Residency Countries in the World.20 Best Permanent Residency Countries in the WorldTo determine the top 20 countries for permanent residency, our focus centered on the key reasons people move, such as improved work opportunities and a better quality of life, encompassing health and education. Our methodology relied on data from the Migrant Integration Policy Index 2020, considering metrics like security of permanent residency, labor market mobility, education, and health integration for each nation. By averaging these scores, we identified countries facilitating smoother relocation while meeting these key objectives. In the case of tied averages, the cost of living index served as a tie-breaker. For instance, if three places had the same scores, 0.2 points were awarded for the highest cost of living index, and 0.1 points for the second highest. A higher average score indicates a more favorable ranking.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.Permanent Residency Score: 63Labor Market Mobility Score: 59Health Score: 65Education Score: 33Insider Monkey Average Score: 55In the Asian region, Japan stands out as one of the best countries for permanent residency. As a developed nation, it ensures a high quality of life for its residents. Geographically well-positioned, Japan provides strategic access to other Asian countries, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific Islands, offering immigrants diverse opportunities. The country's high permanent residency score, coupled with robust health integration and labor mobility prospects, emphasizes the favorable conditions for immigrants to settle comfortably. Notably, Japan's permanent residency is granted indefinitely, in contrast to the continuous renewals or predetermined time limits associated with other visas.Permanent Residency Score: 58Labor Market Mobility Score: 48Health Score: 75Education Score: 40Insider Monkey Average Score: 55.25The United Kingdom remains one of the most favored destinations for expatriates. As a developed nation with high-quality amenities, particularly in education, many individuals aspire to secure permanent residency in the UK. Those with this status can enjoy various benefits, including the right to live and work in the country indefinitely. However, certain situations, such as spending more than two years outside the country or being convicted of a criminal offense, may nullify this right. The overall scores for the country present a positive picture, with a particularly favorable outlook on the health integration of immigrants-- a key incentive for those willing to go through the process of moving abroad.Permanent Residency Score: 50Labor Market Mobility Score: 54Health Score: 61Education Score: 60Insider Monkey Average Score: 56.25The Czech Republic stands out as one of the greatest countries in Europe, offering a safe, stable, and culturally diverse life while maintaining a high standard of living.

       "  '(Bloomberg) -- Buyers of Apple Inc.’s new Vision Pro headset are finding it can be a major hassle if they lose their passcode.Most Read from BloombergA 99% Bond Wipeout Hands Hedge Funds a Harsh Lesson on ChinaBiden’s Attempt to Address Memory Issue Backfires With New GaffeUkraine’s Army Chief Replaced After Rift With ZelenskiyNew York City Is Considering a Laundry Pods CrackdownEinhorn Says Markets ‘Fundamentally Broken’ By Passive, Quant InvestingThe company is telling users who forget their code — typically a series of digits — that they’ll have to bring the device to a store or mail it to AppleCare customer support if they want to get it working again. Apple will then erase and reset it.The issue is one of a few early customer-service snags surrounding the $3,499 device, which went on sale Friday. The company’s support staff also has been fielding questions from users struggling to set up Optic ID — an eye-scanning tool for logging into the device — and the built-in Apple Music app.The passcode problem could be particularly frustrating. When customers enter their passcode incorrectly too many times, the headset will be disabled. If users still can’t recall their passcode after a waiting period, they’ll need to send it back to Apple to be reset, according to guidance given to the company’s support staff. At that point, all content on the device will be erased.It’s a quirk that doesn’t exist with Apple’s other products. The company’s smartwatch, for instance, has a mechanism that lets users set it up again if a passcode is forgotten.It’s possible that Apple makes software changes in the near future that would allow the passcode to be reset without needing to send the product back. An Apple spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment.On Apple’s community forum, one customer said he spoke to an agent who was flooded with calls about the problem. “He’s had to deal with a lot of angry customers after telling them their only recourse is to return to the store,” the user wrote. “He said Apple Support was really caught off guard by this and apologized for not being better prepared.”One complication with the Vision Pro is it doesn’t have a USB-C port that lets users plug it into a Mac for troubleshooting. The company did release a special strap for developers to be able to attach the headset to a Mac last week, but that accessory costs about $300 and isn’t meant for consumers.Read More: Apple Vision Pro Debut Brings New Shopping ExperienceThe Vision Pro is Apple’s first major new hardware category since it began selling smartwatches almost a decade ago. The device isn’t expected to be a blockbuster product — partly due to its hefty price tag — but curious customers streamed into Apple stores over the weekend to try it out. The product’s reception has been generally positive, with reviewers praising its immersive video playback and productivity features.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekOpenAI’s Secret Weapon Is Sam Altman’s 33-Year-Old LieutenantHow Jack Dorsey’s Plan to Get Elon Musk to Save Twitter Went SouthInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went WrongA Tiny Fund Takes a Big Short on Corporate Debt Maturity WallThe Story Elon Musk Doesn’t Want to Talk About©2024 Bloomberg L.P.'],\n",

       "  'I cannot stress enough how risky OTC stocks or securities traded over the counter really are. For one thing, just the name OTC should ring some alarm bells. This designation means that these securities don’t trade on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. Instead, they trade via broker-dealer networks. And not all stock platforms support what’s otherwise known as the pink sheets.Second, many investors are shocked to discover the administrative costs tied to OTC stocks. Yes, many of these securities are “cheap,” trading hands at unit prices well below a buck. However, that doesn’t mean that it’s cheap to you. Wide bid-ask spreads may mean that your holdings may have to rise significantly higher to be net profitable. Also, even if you are profitable, low trading volume could mean a long time to find a buyer.At the same time, OTC stocks or otherwise highly speculative shares can fly higher. Some examples include the following:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMonster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST): In 1997, you could have had MNST for just two cents.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): On a split-adjusted basis, you could have bought AAPL for 10 cents in December 1980.Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD): Back in June 2015, AMD traded for below $2.Of course, there are way more failures than successes. But if you want to go for gold, below are the OTC stocks to consider.Source: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.comA Chinese multinational technology conglomerate, Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) has had a rough outing in 2023. Mainly, that’s due to the challenging circumstances surrounding the Chinese economy. And if a CNN report proves correct, 2024 could be an even rougher outing. Still, Tencent’s expansionary ambitions reach beyond its home nation. With eyes on Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, and several other international regions, Tencent could be interesting for speculators.To be sure, with a market capitalization of around $337.5 billion, TCEHY doesn’t exactly rate as one of the typical OTC stocks. However, it’s a great confidence booster because it’s in some ways the best of both worlds: offering tremendous upside potential while also being a technology stalwart in its home nation.Analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $49.56 average price target. That implies an upside potential of over 40%. What’s more, the high-side target hits $61.13, possibly delivering growth of over 73%. If that wasn’t enough to whet your appetite, shares trade at only 13.06X forward earnings, below the interactive media sector’s median value of 21.19X.Source: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.comMoving on to another Chinese company, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) presents a unique proposition. First, it’s a major automotive enterprise specializing in electric vehicles, yet it technically ranks among the OTC stocks. Second, Warren Buffett – who is best known for investing in reliable blue chips – owns BYD via Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B). To be fair, Buffett has been reducing his exposure but he still owns a sizable amount.Despite the seemingly contradictory tone, investors may want to consider adding BYDDF to their portfolio. Yeah, it’s one of the OTC stocks and yes, the Chinese economy looks rather putrid if I’m being honest. However, with EVs becoming increasingly commoditized, guess who’s going to win that battle? There’s just no way that western nations can compete with their higher labor costs.Also, investors should consider another element: demand. European politicians may want to reduce the flood of Chinese EVs. But their constituents? They love ‘em. So do analysts, who rate BYDDF a consensus strong buy with a $36.03 price target. That implies 63% upside potential.Source: buffaloboy / Shutterstock.comYet one more Chinese company to discuss and then we’ll get into the really wild OTC stocks. A designer and manufacturer of consumer electronics and related software, Xiaomi (OTCMKTS:XIACF) is a cynical play. For example, beyond its consumer electronics business, it’s also involved in the EV space. Recently, the company launched its first electric-powered vehicle, which might have caught the eyes of some lawyers.I’m joking there, but seriously, the Xiaomi SU7 looks like it ripped off the design of a particular German brand. But if the consumers who love BYD offer any clues, the SU7 should be a hit. Apparently, it has the performance (up to 664 horsepower) and the longevity to better the top players in the ecosystem. And even if you didn’t like the EV pivot, Xiaomi should win in consumer electronics.Frankly, with smart devices becoming so commoditized, people may start looking to price more often than brand. If so, XIACF has a clear pathway to robust shareholder profits. Analysts agree, rating the stock a unanimous strong buy with a $2.66 average price target.Source: ShutterstockOkay, let’s buckle up for some serious OTC stocks and by that, I mean high risk, high reward. First, Quisitive Technology Solutions (OTCMKTS:QUISF) bills itself as a premier global Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) partner that harnesses its cloud platforms and complete technologies to generate transformational impact for midsize and enterprise-level customers. It’s an intriguing idea because, at one point, shares closed at $1.54 on a weekly average basis.Currently, QUISF trades hands at only 22 cents. And you should note that over the past 52 weeks, it lost more than 53% of its equity value. Further, according to the security’s point-and-figure (P&F) chart, it prints a double bottom breakdown. According to StockCharts.com’s educational section, this pattern is a bearish signal. That said, the pattern should also be viewed in a broader context due to possible whipsaw effects.And what is that context? Basically, the broader cloud computing market could be worth $2.43 trillion by 2030. Quisitive just needs to take a bite out of this market to potentially drive higher. Analysts seem to be on the same page, pegging the average price target at 49 cents.Source: ShutterstockAs a fan of the uranium energy space, I perked up when I came across this opportunity hidden among OTC stocks. As a uranium extraction specialist, Peninsula Energy (OTCMKTS:PENMF) addresses a critical supply shortage that recently sprouted. According to The Wall Street Journal, last month, uranium prices jumped to a 16-year high after one of the world’s largest producers – Kazakhstan’s state-owned company Kazatomprom – warned of production target shortfalls.With uranium supplies uncertain for the next two years, several uranium players have skyrocketed. One of the exceptions is PENMF. In the trailing one-year period, the security declined by 8%. That said, it is up 15% on a year-to-date basis but that’s a modest performance compared to exchange-listed uranium specialists.Still, as far as OTC stocks are concerned, Peninsula could be intriguing because of geopolitical considerations. Basically, it features 100% ownership of the Lance Project, which is one of the largest uranium projects in the U.S.Better yet, analysts expect great things, pegging shares a moderate buy with a 17-cent target. That implies almost 85% upside potential, with the high-side target landing at 22 cents.Source: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comBased in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Saturn Oil & Gas (OTCMKTS:OILSF) is a resource company engaged in the business of acquisition, exploration and development of petroleum and natural gas resource despoits in Western Canada. Further, the company’s current focus is to advance the exploration and development of its oil and gas properties in Alberta and Saskatchewan.As an upstream player in the hydrocarbon space, Saturn might not seem particularly relevant. Late last year, many oil-producing nations agreed to cut production in a bid to bolster prices. However, that effort did not succeed. Also, Reuters recently reported that rising U.S. oil production has frustrated the aforementioned oil producers. So, it seems OILSF could be one of the losing OTC stocks.However, the blowout January jobs report suggests that we shouldn’t quite give up on black gold just yet. More people with jobs should translate to more resource consumption. And to be blunt, renewable energy just won’t be enough to feed the growing demand profile. Notably, Echelon Wealth Partners believes OILSF could hit $4.22 per share or 137% up.Source: THICHA SATAPITANON / ShutterstockBefore discussing radiation oncology medical device firm Vivos (OTCMKTS:RDGL), it’s important to disclose that I own RDGL stock. Please make a decision based on your own due diligence and a sober reflection of your risk tolerance. This is a security that has already lost almost 28% YTD and is likely subject to severe market turbulence.With the caveats out of the way, Vivos is engaged in the development of its yttrium-90-based brachytherapy device, RadioGel, for the treatment of non-resectable tumors. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, brachytherapy is a radiation treatment that is given directly into the patient’s body. Typically, the radiation is deployed using tiny devices such as wires, seeds, or rods filled with radioactive materials.Where Vivos distinguishes itself is that RadioGel utilizes an injectable particle-gel, which delivers a very high local radiation dose. More broadly, RDGL entices speculators because the underlying industry is still in its early innings, worth $907.76 million in 2022.As for a price target, it’s difficult to say as no analyst currently covers RDGL. However, based on my personal research, I believe around 5 cents is the bottom.Penny StocksOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks:\\xa0With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

       "  'Apple Vision Pro owners seem willing to pay thousands of dollars to not look at the world in front of them.Since Apple Vision Pro’s Friday release across U.S. stores — with an eye-watering starting price of $3,500 — people have been spotted wearing their headsets courtside at NBA games, at the gym, on the subway, and crossing the street. At least two viral videos show people in the driver’s seat of a moving Tesla while still wearing the Apple Vision Pro headset, drawing criticism from government officials and other advocates for distraction-free driving.“Driving while wearing a VR headset is reckless and disregards the safety of everyone on the road,” \\xa0a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration spokesperson told Fortune in a statement. “All vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems require a fully attentive human driver performing the driving task and monitoring the surrounding environment at all times.”The Apple Vision Pro user guide warns users to “never use Apple Vision Pro while operating a moving vehicle, bicycle, heavy machinery, or in any other situations requiring attention to safety.”Distracted driving in the U.S. is a growing problem. The NHTSA reported 3,522 deaths in 2021 — compared to 3,142 the year before, a 12% increase — from distracted driving, or “any activity that diverts attention from driving” like texting, eating, or fiddling with your in-car entertainment. These accidents account for between 8-9% of car-related deaths in the U.S.Cars with self-driving features have dangers of their own. Tesla recalled 2 million vehicles in December due to issues with the self-driving features, and U.S. safety regulators have investigated 1,000 Tesla Autopilot-related accidents, 40 of which were fatal.While there isn’t comprehensive evidence on the prevalence of distracted driving in partially automated vehicles, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, there’s a widespread perception that partially automated vehicles are the same as fully self-driving cars, which has led drivers to take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel.Dante Lentini, who posted a video of himself wearing the Apple Vision Pro headset while in the driver’s seat of a partially automated Tesla and appearing to be pulled over by police, told Fortune that the stunt wasn’t as dangerous as it looked. He said his device was on transparency mode and that he was viewing the road from the headset’s cameras. Lentini said an Apple engineer told him the Apple Vision Pro has a steering-wheel detector that does not allow users in the driver seat to use its apps. Apple did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.Wearing the headset while driving isn’t as dangerous as using other technologies behind the wheel, Lentini argued.“While I understand the initial backlash and concern, I believe people may not know the device displays a passthrough vision display of what’s in front of me,” he said. “While I don’t recommend driving with it on, I would find someone being on their phone or even eating to be more hindered.”Despite the video showing a police car pulled up behind him in a parking lot, Lentini was not pulled over or given a citation. The video was meant to be a skit, he said.Lentini wasn’t busted for distracted driving, and inconsistencies in laws banning distracting technology in cars may explain why.The use of handheld devices while driving is illegal in 24 states, and texting is illegal in 48 states, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics — and in all but two of those states, texting while driving is a primary law. That means law enforcement can ticket a driver for distracted driving without any other traffic violation, such as speeding.But texting only accounts for some of the distractions behind the wheel. Two-thirds of drivers surveyed by the IIHS reported performing a distracting activity behind the wheel, like using a navigation app, making a call, or reading texts. Eight percent of those surveyed reported playing a video game while driving.While 35 states have laws that prohibit screens in drivers’ lines of sight, some of those states, such as New York and New Jersey, limit the ban to television, not internet streaming. In states like Texas, similar bans don’t apply to devices with screens mounted near the dashboard.The introduction of face-mounted technology further complicates how distracted-driving laws are enforced. In 2013, Southern California driver Cecelia Abadie was pulled over and given a speeding ticket while driving wearing Google Glass, an Android mixed-reality product. She was given an additional citation for wearing Google Glass. California vehicle code 27602 outlines that a person should not drive if a screen pointed toward the driver is displaying video. Both charges were thrown out because of lack of evidence that the device was turned on and playing video.By February 2014, several states introduced legislation regulating the use of Google Glass behind the wheel. Google led lobbying efforts to kill bills banning Google Glass use while driving, arguing because the product was not yet readily available, banning it would be premature. Google Glass prototype sales ended in January 2015, but Google’s most recent enterprise version of the device was on the market from 2019 to 2023.It’s unclear if Apple Vision Pro will face similar regulatory hurdles as the Google Glass but until it does, expect more inadvisable headset sightings in online stunts.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com'],\n",

While Meta may have stolen the show on Friday, let’s check out Amazon and Apple’s quarterly results and see if now is a good time to buy stock in these iconic tech giants.Amazon Q4 Review Rounding out its fiscal 2023 Amazon reported Q4 earnings of $1.01 per share which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus of $0.81 a share by 24%. Even better, Q4 earnings soared 380% from $0.21 a share in the comparative quarter. Fourth quarter sales of $169.96 billion beat estimates by 2% and leaped 14% YoY. Amazon produced Q4 net income of $10.6 billion which skyrocketed from the $300 million the e-commerce bohemoth brought in a year ago.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmazon attributed its very strong Q4 results to a record-breaking holiday shopping season and saw 13% and 17% growth in its North America and International segment sales respectively. In terms of its cloud services, Amazon’s AWS segment sales were up 13% to $24.2 billion during Q4 but slightly missed estimates of $24.37 billion.Still, Amazon’s total sales were up 12% in FY23 to $574.8 billion with net income of $30.4 billion climb swinging from a net loss of -$2.7 billion a year ago. This translated into annual earnings of $2.90 per share which skyrocketed 308% from $0.71 a share in 2022.\\xa0\\xa0Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchApple Q1 ReviewReporting its fiscal first quarter results of Friday, Apple’s Q1 earnings of $2.18 per share was up 16% YoY to a new record high and topped the Zacks Consensus of $2.09 a share by 4%. Quarterly sales of $119.57 billion topped estimates by over 1% and rose 2% YoY. Apple reported net income of $33.92 billion which jumped 13% from the prior year quarter.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchApple’s Q1 growth was fueled by iPhone sales and an all-time revenue record in its Services segment sales which includes Apple news, music, and TV along with its App Store, iCloud, AppleCare, and Apple Pay. iPhone sales came in at $69.7 billion and beat estimates by 1% although Services sales of $23.11 billion were still -1% short of the consensus of $23.39 billion.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineFollowing their favorable quarterly results Amazon’s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Apple lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

       "  'In this article, we will be taking a look at the 13 best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts. To skip our detailed analysis of the US tech industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.For most of 2023, the tech sector seemed to have established itself as a safe haven for many investors with its prolonged rallies, helped by the rising interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and the growing profitability of several large tech companies. It seems as though these positive trends are continuing in 2024, with many investors remaining faithful to their tech holdings and expecting higher profitability from their investments as the year progresses. With such strong optimism driving up the tech stocks, many are beginning to wonder whether this obsession with tech stocks ever come to an end and whether other names in the market will ever gain investor attention again.On February 1, Mizuho Americas\\' Farzin Azarm joined CNBC\\'s \"Street Signs Asia\" to discuss current trends in the US tech sector and this investor obsession with tech stocks. Here are some of his comments:\"Everybody is in the US tech names, everybody, and nobody\\'s selling these names because why would they? Every day you come in, NVIDIA\\'s making a new all time high, look at what Meta is doing after hours look at what Amazon is doing after hours. It\\'s been a safe haven and people are saying \\'why should I abandon these names that have given me a return every day? Why should I move away from something like this and invest in something that risky, that hasn\\'t given me any kind of a return?\\'\"According to Azarm, this continued preference for US tech stocks is resulting in other stocks, notably those originating in China, being ignored. He believes that a \"crack\" in the US tech and AI trade is the only thing that will rotate money back into Chinese stocks at the end of the day. He added that because investors have already committed huge amounts to expensive American stocks, they do not have the appetite to invest further in more expensive companies. As such, he believes that when the US tech rally slows down, cheaper valuation Chinese companies may begin to attract investor attention. On this front, here\\'s what Azarm had to say:\"People are looking for underperformance, people are looking for... cheaper valuation companies. The US names are trading at 30-35 times now, some of these names. They\\'re priced to perfection. They\\'re not going down, it\\'s amazing to me, but once it does, and it\\'s gonna come, I think that money may go to China.\"In light of the above, it is unsurprising that major names such as\\xa0Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) continue to be considered some of the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts and investors alike. These companies are some of the best long-term tech stocks to invest in and have been dubbed the best tech stocks to buy for several years, all due to their stellar performance. But they have been joined by many other notable names, which our list below will highlight.Our MethodologyWe have selected the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts by using a stock screener to identify American tech stocks and then shortlisting the top stocks based on their upside potential according to Wall Street analysts. The stocks are ranked from the lowest to the highest upside potential as of February 5. We have also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock. Some leading companies, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), had to be excluded from our list because of their low upside potential.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Upside Potential According to Analysts: 8.53%Average Price Target: $46.42Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California. It develops, manufactures, markets, and sells computing and related products and services.A Buy rating was maintained on shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) on January 26 by Vijay Rakesh at Mizuho, alongside a price target of $55.In the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds were long Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), with a total stake value of $2.1 billion.Upslope Capital Management mentioned Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Intel Corporation\\xa0(NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”Like Alphabet Inc.

       "  'The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Dow 30, is meant to be a collection of prestigious blue-chip stocks that represent the U.S. economy well. However, not every company on the Dow is a good investment and is instead one of several doomed Dow stocks. Many stocks have a record of underperformance. So much so that analysts and market observers openly question the composition of the Dow 30 and have called for a shake-up of the index.While the Dow is currently at a record high, it has a history of trailing the other two main U.S. indices, the benchmark S&P 500 and the technology-laden Nasdaq. Even in 2023, when it reached a record high, the Dow rose 13.70% on the year compared to a 23.79% return from the S&P 500 and a 42.13% return from the Nasdaq. Here are three doomed Dow stocks to dump before they dive: February 2024.Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.comIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has just announced that it is delaying the construction of a new $20 billion microchip and semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio. The plant is expected to help Intel manufacture microchips and semiconductors that other companies design and eventually rivaling Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). Intel planned to have the Ohio plant up and running in 2025. Construction was delayed to late 2026.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe announced delay of the Ohio plant came a week after Intel reported financial results that included disappointing guidance. The outlook was so bad that it sent INTC stock down 11% in one trading day. While profits and sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 beat Wall Street expectations, Intel forecast earnings of 13 cents on $12.20 billion to $13.20 billion in revenue for the current first quarter 2024. Analysts had been looking for earnings of 33 cents a share on $14.15 billion of revenue.Intel said that its core businesses of personal computer and server chips would be at the low end of the company’s range in the current quarter. INTC stock is now down 10% on the year and sinking.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comIn its latest earnings report, U.S. oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) seemed to mask some ugly numbers by announcing that it’s raising its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by 8%. The dividend increase appeared to generate a lot of headlines, as did news that Chevron returned a record $23.60 billion to its shareholders in 2023 by paying out $11.30 billion in dividends and buying back $14.90 billion of its own stock. However, the company’s actual financial results showed some troubling data.Despite the record payout, Chevron’s profit declined 40% to $21.30 billion last year from $35.50 billion in 2022 when crude oil prices were above $100 a barrel. While profits in the fourth and final quarter of 2023 beat expectations, it was largely due to cost-cutting. Revenue in Q4 2023 came in at $47.18 billion, below the $51.62 billion expected on Wall Street. Profits from the company’s refining operations dropped 35% year-over-year to $1.15 billion in Q4.In its earnings print, Chevron said it continues to struggle with volatile crude oil prices, which are likely to get more volatile as tensions in the Middle East worsen and China’s economic downturn deepens. Chevron is also acquiring rival Hess (NYSE:HES) for $53 billion, which is a deal many analysts are questioning. CVX stock has declined 10% in the last year.Source: Moab Republic / ShutterstockApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a perception problem, hurting the company’s share price. Apple’s latest earnings print was actually better-than-expected, with profits and sales topping Wall Street forecasts. iPhone sales revenue totaled $69.70 billion versus the expected $67.82 billion. Apple’s overall revenue rose 2% year-over-year in Q4 2023, breaking a streak of four consecutive quarters with annual revenue declines. In most respects, the print was a success.However, AAPL stock declined after the earnings were public because analysts and investors focused on the company’s reported 13% decline in iPhone sales in China during Q4. China remains one of Apple’s most important markets, accounting for 20% of its iPhone sales worldwide. Any slowdown in China is a black eye for Apple. While the sales drop in China is due to an economic slowdown, domestic competition, and politics, it nevertheless hurts Apple’s stock.AAPL stock is flat on the year but has trailed the performance of other mega-cap technology stocks over the past year. It also recently lost the crown as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company to rival Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). And it has had multiple analyst downgrades since the start of the year. Right or wrong, the impression is that Apple’s growth is slowing.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole\\xa0held long positions in APPL and MSFT.

Although Apple also surpassed Wall Street’s estimates and reported for the first time in a year its revenue grew, its stock fell after-hours. Microsoft reported a thriving bottom line along with impressive growth of its cloud business. But even Microsoft isn’t immune to corporate layoffs that are still plaguing the tech industry. Google also reported strong top and bottom-line figures but missed analyst estimates. Therefore, Google shares went down more than 6% upon earnings on Tuesday. Moreover, Google remains focused on cost-management.But Meta did more than greatly surpass analyst estimates with its fourth quarter figures along with announcing its first ever dividend as it continues to work on making the metaverse happen with its Reality Labs division that hit $1 billion for the first time in the latest reported quarter.For the quarter ended in December, Meta reported its revenue jumped 25% YoY to\\xa0$40.1 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $39.18 billion\\xa0as the ad business continued to rebound after a brutal 2022. Meta also lowered its expenses\\xa08% YoY to $23.73 billion and as a result of efficient cost-cutting initiatives, its operating margin more than doubled to 41%.\\xa0Therefore, net income more than tripled to $14 billion, or $5.33 per share.\\xa0Earnings per share amounted to $5.33, also topping LSEG’s estimate of\\xa0$4.96.Although its virtual\\xa0reality unit recorded a loss of\\xa0$4.65 billion,\\xa0Reality Labs\\xa0\\xa0passed $1 billion for the first time which shows Meta continues to advance on the metaverse and AI front.CEO Mark Zuckerberg also revealed that AI advances helped boost the company’s ad business which grew faster than of its rival Google that earlier reported YoY growth of 11% for its latest quarter. Along with other social media executives, Zuckerberg was questioned during a law hearing on Wednesday for being accused for\\xa0insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and even deaths by suicide. Zuckerberg has been working on restoring his image by examining ways to curb harm made by social media platforms, but these ‘products’ have created a lot of harm to the most fragile generations.Meta announced it pay its investors a dividend of 50 cents a share on March 26th.Facebook parent guided for first-quarter sales in the range between $34.5 billion and $37 billion, topping analyst estimates of $33.8 billion. Meta also guided for 2024 expenses to be between $94 billion and $99 billion.Like Google, Meta remains focused on keeping things lean. Although its greatest goal is to make the metaverse happen, it has perhaps an even harder task of having to prove its products are not harming the mental health and lives of its users.

       "  \"Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google Search is totally back to kick off 2024. But as investors' collective focus pivoted to profitable growth during the bear market, this is where the company stood out. Total operating income profit margins dialed in at 27.5% in Q4 2023, up from 24% a year ago.With profits rising again, Alphabet went to work last year doling out more shareholder returns. And those returns comprise the 61.5 billion reasons Alphabet is still a buy and hold in my book for 2024.Alphabet revealed in its Q4 2023 financial filings that it shelled out a whopping $61.5 billion worth of share buybacks last year. That was a near-4% increase from 2022. Not bad for a bear market.Granted, Alphabet also doled out employee stock-based compensation of $22.5 billion last year. Nevertheless, the buybacks still more than offset that amount and effectively reduced the total share count along the way. Investors were rewarded with a net 3.3% decrease in average shares outstanding in 2023 (a lower share count boosts earnings per share for remaining shareholders).Paired with those profit margin increases, the lowered share count is what helped Alphabet report a massive 56% year-over-year increase in earnings per share in Q4 2023.Of course, of the world's largest tech companies that also repurchase stock as part of their shareholder return policy, Apple reigns supreme. (Amazon\\xa0is excluded here, as it has no current stock buyback program.)However, what's impressive about Alphabet's shareholder returns is that it was also able to pull this off, all the while shelling out massive amounts of cash to upgrade its data centers and global infrastructure for a new era of artificial intelligence and accelerated computing. Purchases of property and equipment (or capex) totaled $32.3 billion last year. By comparison, Apple's capex was about one-third of Alphabet's.That speaks volumes about Apple's efficiency in designing and selling top consumer products, but let's not take too much away from Alphabet. It's a totally different business model, one where constant data center upgrades to support its internet-based business are a necessity.And in spite of all the capex spending and $61.5 billion in stock buybacks, Alphabet didn't even make a dent in its massive cash hoard. At the end of the year, it had cash and short-term equivalents of $111 billion, plus long-term investments of $31 billion. That's relatively unchanged from the cash and equivalents of $114 billion, and long-term investments of $30.5 billion, at the end of 2022.In other words, Alphabet still has plenty of room to return even more cash to its shareholders in the years to come.Alphabet's various businesses continue to make more changes to focus on shareholder value creation as 2024 gets rolling. Google Cloud is only just now hitting the 10% operating profit margin threshold, so it has space to run higher. And the Google Other Bets segment (X Labs, which houses start-ups like Waymo) also said it will be bringing in outside investors starting this year to unlock more potential.If profit margins increase again this year, I expect another ramp-up in Alphabet's stock buybacks. This, paired with all that cash on the balance sheet, is a top reason I'm content to keep holding my shares for the long haul.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

Here’s its path.Snap’s stock plummets 30% on revenue miss, weak guidanceInvestors typically consider value stocks to be those of mature companies that are steady performers, are likely to pay dividends to shareholders and trade at relatively low valuations to the broad market.On Friday, when Meta’s META stock rose 20% after the company announced a 25% increase in revenue and a tripling of profit from the year-earlier quarter, investors obviously saw the type of growth they wanted and felt the shares had been bargain-priced as of Thursday’s close.Here’s coverage of an amazing Friday for Meta and its CEO:So what are we to think of Meta’s stock now? Can Meta be considered a value stock, or a bargain? Let’s look ahead and then take a look back at how the company has grown, to answer that question.Let’s begin with a look at Meta’s forward price-to-earnings ratio, which is based on Friday’s closing price (following the 20% pop), and updated consensus estimates for earnings per share for the next 12 months among analysts polled by FactSet.Meta is one of the “Magnificent Seven,” a group of very large U.S. companies that dominated the 2023 rally for the S&P 500 SPX. The other companies in the group are Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Apple Inc. AAPL, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Tesla Inc.

We are using estimates for calendar years because Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple and Broadcom have fiscal years that don’t match the calendar.CompanyTicker2-year estimated sales per share CAGR through 20252-year estimated EPS CAGR through 20252-year estimated FCF CAGR through 2025Forward P/EMicrosoft Corp.MSFT14.7%16.7%19.7%32.6Apple Inc.AAPL4.4%8.2%11.0%27.4Amazon.com Inc.AMZN11.7%35.7%36.4%41.0Alphabet Inc.

This is money that can be used to fund expansion or to increase dividends, buy back shares (which can lower the share count and boost EPS) or for other corporate purposes. The relatively low expected FCF CAGR for Meta reflects the company’s plans to increase hiring and spending on various initiatives, including hardware to support artificial intelligence, data centers and product development.Here’s the group again, this time showing five-year CAGR for sales, EPS and FCF and earnings through 2023, with adjustments and estimates by FactSet for companies whose fiscal years don’t match the calendar:CompanyTicker5-year sales CAGR through 20235-year EPS CAGR through 20235-year FCF CAGR through 2023Microsoft Corp.MSFT14.0%19.8%15.6%Apple Inc.AAPL8.0%15.5%15.3%Amazon.com Inc.AMZN19.8%23.5%18.3%Alphabet Inc.

It isn’t a perfect tool to measure performance, in part because different industries are naturally more capital-intensive than others.Note that the carrying value of a company’s stock may be much lower than its current market capitalization. The company may have issued most of its shares many years ago at a price much lower than today’s price. If a company has issued a relatively large amount of newer shares recently, or at high prices, its ROIC will be lower. If a company has low debt, its ROIC is higher. If a company is being forced to increase borrowings, especially as interest rates are rising, its ROIC will go down.FactSet measures ROIC by rolling 12-month periods through companies’ most recently reported fiscal quarters. So we looked back at the past 10 12-month periods for the 10 companies. Here are average, minimum and maximum ROIC for five and 10 years:CompanyTicker5-year average ROIC5-year min ROIC5-year max ROIC10-year average ROIC10-year min ROIC10-year max ROICMicrosoft Corp.MSFT28.0%24.5%32.6%21.5%9.7%32.6%Apple Inc.AAPL48.4%28.7%62.0%37.5%22.5%62.0%Amazon.com Inc.AMZN9.9%-1.0%15.4%7.8%-1.3%15.4%Alphabet Inc.

The company ranked fourth for 10 years.Apple ranks highest for both periods, in part reflecting so many years of strong performance and free cash flow to fund its expansion. But Meta’s solid long-term record — including the fourth-highest minimum ROIC for the 10-year period — provides comfort to support its relatively low P/E valuation, especially after Friday’s surge for the shares.In conclusion, one can and should call Meta a growth stock. But it also seems to represent a good value at these levels, based on expectations for rapid growth of sales and earnings through 2025, the look back and the overall valuation of the S&P 500.Don’t miss:  Too much ‘Magnificent Seven’?

       "  'Good Monday and happy morning. Welcome to TheStreet\\'s daily tech roundup.In case you haven\\'t seen clips of folks wearing headsets in odd situations, the Apple Vision Pro has officially been released, and Wedbush\\'s Dan Ives thinks this is \"just the start\" for Apple\\'s big push into virtual reality and spatial computing.Deepfakes, meanwhile, are becoming more prolific — signifying, in the words of artificial intelligence expert Gary Marcus, the arrival of \"\\'Black Mirror,\\' ahead of schedule\" — and OpenAI\\'s latest research paper regarding the biological threat of AI is, in Marcus\\' words, \"deeply worrisome.\"And the billionaire tech magnate Elon Musk has been accused — again — of using illegal drugs.Related: Deepfake porn: It\\'s not just about Taylor SwiftTech earnings season continues this week, with Palantir  (PLTR)  reporting Monday, Spotify  (SPOT)  and Snap  (SNAP)  reporting Tuesday, Disney  (DIS) , Uber  (UBER)  and Roblox  (RBLX)  reporting Wednesday and Cloudflare  (NET)  up on Thursday.Tickers we\\'re watching today: Apple  (AAPL) , Tesla  (TSLA)  and Microsoft  (MSFT) .Let\\'s get into it.Related: Stock Market Today: Stocks slide, bond yields leap as Fed rate-cut bets fadeApple\\'s  (AAPL)  long-awaited Vision Pro headset officially went on sale Friday, spawning such videos as this one, where a man is driving his Tesla Cybertruck while clad in the techno goggles.Tesla Cybertruck meet Apple Vision Pro! pic.twitter.com/CFk4PAviZs— Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) February 4, 2024Ives called the headset a \"potential game changer\" over the coming years, especially considering Apple\\'s ecosystem of 2.2 billion active iOS devices around the world.Though he acknowledged that at its current price — $3,500 — the Vision Pro is inaccessible to most, he added that he was \"surprised at the early mass market appeal\" of the device.Wedbush believes Apple will sell 600,000 Vision Pro units in 2024 (earning revenue of about $2.1 billion).Reiterating that his expectation for the future of the device involves consecutively lower price ranges (and smaller designs that better resemble sunglasses than they do space goggles), Ives said that Apple will exceed one million Vision Pro sales in 2025.\"While many on the Street are dismissing Vision Pro as noise, we strongly disagree and believe its the first step towards a much broader technology vision that (CEO Tim Cook) & Co. plan to push to its installed base over the coming years,\" Ives wrote, reiterating his outperform rating and $250 price target on the stock.The average price target for Apple is $205, according to TipRanks. Ives is the most bullish Apple investor on the Street at $250.Related: Analyst who correctly warned Tesla stock could fall unveils new targetConcerns about AI-generated deepfakes have been mounting recently; deepfake robocalls of President Joe Biden were reported ahead of the New Hampshire primary, and Taylor Swift was a recent victim of AI-generated deepfake porn.On Sunday, a finance worker at a firm in Hong Kong became the latest to fall victim to AI-generated deepfakes, paying $25 million to fraudsters who, according to CNN, used deepfake technology to resemble the company\\'s chief financial officer in a video call.Despite the worker\\'s initial suspicion regarding the request, he proceeded with the transaction because the people in the video call looked and sounded like known company colleagues.\"\\'Black Mirror\\' has arrived, ahead of schedule,\" Marcus wrote in response to the report.\"In the end, I am reminded of the economist’s term negative externalities,\" he added. \"In the old days, factories generated pollution and expected everyone else to deal with the consequences. Now it’s AI developers who are expecting to do what they do scot-free, while society picks up the tab.\"Related: How one tech company is tackling the recent proliferation of deepfake fraudTurning to Tesla  (TSLA) , the Wall Street Journal published another piece detailing Musk\\'s alleged drug use, a follow-up to the Journal\\'s similarly-themed January article that both Musk and his attorney refuted.According to the report, Musk\\'s drug use resulted in former Tesla board member and Oracle founder Larry Ellison urging Musk to come to his Hawaiian island to \"dry out.\" Friends and people close to Musk allegedly asked him to go to rehab.Musk responded to these allegations in a post on X, saying that \"no one has ever mentioned rehab\" to him.\"Second, if they are saying that I was able to lead Tesla to be by far the most valuable carmaker and SpaceX to be by far the most valuable space company *simultaneously*, that is the greatest compliment I have ever received!\" he added.This comes in the wake of a Delaware judge\\'s decision to strike down Musk\\'s nearly $56 billion compensation package; the judge called the process for approving the package \"deeply flawed,\" citing Musk\\'s \"extensive ties\" with some of the directors who approved it.The Journal\\'s report alleges that several Tesla directors have consumed drugs with Musk.Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, meanwhile released a lengthy thread on X defending Tesla\\'s compensation package for Musk and calling the Delaware court\\'s decision \"un-American, an assault on investor rights and an insult to the board of Directors of one of the most stunningly successful companies in U.S. history.\"Related: Analyst reveals new Tesla price target with focus on undervalued business unitLast week, OpenAI released the results of a study with the goal of determining whether AI could aid bad actors in developing bioweapons, a concern shared by the U.K.\\'s House of Lords and the White House.Though the results found that access to GPT-4 \"may increase experts\\' ability to access information about biological threats,\" OpenAI said that the results are unclear and more research must be done in this area.In analyzing the paper, however, Marcus found much more decisive areas of concern.The study involved 100 participants, half of which were experts in biology and half of which were students who had taken college-level biology. The group was then split randomly into two sections, one with access to unrestricted GPT-4 and the internet and one with access only to the internet.The results found that in nearly every test, both students and experts were more accurate with AI than without. OpenAI dismissed this in a footnote as statistically insignificant, a move that Marcus called the result of misanalyzing the data.\"Crucially, if even one malicious expert gets over the hump and creates a deadly pathogen; that’s huge,\" Marcus said. \"The results make it look like that sort of thing might be possible.\"He added that even if GPT-4 isn\\'t quite good enough to assist any expert in the creation of a bioweapon, that is no confirmation that the next iteration of the model — GPT-5 — won\\'t be good enough to accomplish that exact scenario.The paper was not peer-reviewed.\"If an LLM (Large Language Model) equips even one team of lunatics with the ability to build, weaponize and distribute even one pathogen as deadly as Covid-19, it will be a really, really big deal,\" Marcus said.Contact Ian with AI stories via email, ian.krietzberg@thearenagroup.net, or Signal 732-804-1223.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024'],\n",

       "  \"By looking at its current market cap of $2.9 trillion, investors can easily come to the conclusion that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a fantastic stock historically. Just in the last five years, shares have soared 348%, crushing the broader Nasdaq Composite index.But this top FAANG stock currently sits 6% below its peak price from last December (as of Feb. 1). So, some investors might be ready to buy the dip.As we look out over the next three years, where will Apple stock be? Let's consider some important factors that investors should be looking at.Despite being launched as far back as 2007 and having more than a dozen different iterations over the years, Apple still depends heavily on the iPhone for its financial success. In the most recent quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30), this popular smartphone raked in $69.7 billion of revenue, representing 58% of Apple's total. That's not necessarily a bad thing on the surface, but the issue is that the iPhone is registering slower growth these days. Its revenue in Q1 2024 was up 6% compared to the year-ago period.This points to the maturity of the iPhone. To its credit, the product's pricing power has resulted in the iPhone representing roughly 80% of the industry's operating income. But with upgrades becoming less and less revolutionary, it's easy for consumers to hold off buying a new device.Apple has other popular hardware products, like the iPad, MacBook, Watch, and AirPods, that could potentially drive growth over the years. And there are still rumors swirling around that the business is working on an autonomous vehicle that could be released in a few years. All of these could help move the needle financially for the company and lead to less focus on the iPhone.Nonetheless, I think in three years, the iPhone will still be a major driver of business results.Generating 19% of revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter, Apple's services registered growth of 11% year over year, which was faster than the products segment. This division includes a variety of offerings, like iCloud, Music, Pay, Fitness+, and TV+.On their own, the services might not be anything too special. But because they help to differentiate Apple's hardware products, they are what makes up the company's ecosystem. In other words, buying a piece of hardware from Apple might provide the business with a one-time sale, but it's the growth of software and services that keeps users engaged and helps generate recurring revenue.The segment posted an impressive gross margin of 72.8% in Q1. There's no reason to believe that software won't continue to report faster revenue growth than products for the foreseeable future. And this could help lift profitability for the company overall going forward.Now that you have some understanding of the two key components of Apple's business, we can try to figure out how the stock will perform over the next three years. Bullish investors are certainly hoping that the company's historical streak of rewarding shareholders can continue.Thanks to its impressive outperformance in the past, Apple shares are far from cheap. They trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 30.5, which is significantly more expensive than their trailing-10-year average of 20.9. This is a very expensive stock that is priced for perfection.If Apple was reporting monster growth, then maybe paying that valuation would make sense. But this is a much more mature enterprise, so growth would have to seriously pick up to justify paying a premium valuation.Consequently, I wouldn't be surprised if Apple's stock underperforms the Nasdaq Composite index between now and the start of 2027.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

       "  \"Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +2.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 0.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share, indicating a change of +2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.57 points to a change of +7.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.18 indicates a change of +9.4% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $92.41 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -2.6%. The $392.87 billion and $417.12 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.5% and +6.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryApple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'Microsoft\\xa0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is number one again, thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. It passed\\xa0Apple\\xa0(NASDAQ:AAPL) in January and is now worth over $3 trillion.Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, MSFT stock is up over 55%. That’s a gain of over $1.5 trillion in market cap. Microsoft’s valuation crossed $1 trillion\\xa0less than five years ago.However, even with its post-earnings fall on January 30, MSFT stock is far from cheap. You’re paying nearly 36 times the company’s $11.06/share of earnings at its current price. The yield on its $3/share annual dividend is down to 0.75%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSmall wonder traders took some profits. What should investors do?The post-earnings fall from a high of $411 was overdue. I’m a big-tech investor, but valuations made me antsy. My\\xa0recent piece\\xa0on\\xa0Advanced Micro Devices\\xa0(NASDAQ:AMD) reflects it. That stock kept climbing after my story and is now only slightly higher than it was when I sold it.My personal view on MSFT stock is that you own it; don’t trade it. I have always reinvested Microsoft dividends, letting them compound, giving me 63 shares of “free” stock for every 100 I own by my last count.I expect Microsoft stock to have rough days in February as traders pick apart\\xa0the most recent earnings. Consumer revenue growth is slowing to below 10%, while cloud services are up 21% and Office365 15%. Is that sustainable?Microsoft has aggressively monetized AI on a gross level, charging $30 per user for its Office\\xa0Co-Pilot. If you bought a consumer version of Office at roughly $100/year, that’s now $460! How many of the 78.4 million consumer Office customers will buy Co-Pilot? More important, what value will we get from it? These questions will drive analysts’ view of the whole industry.The AI complex will catch a cold the next time Microsoft sniffles.2024 will be a year of heavy marketing at Microsoft, which now has 221,000 employees, up 50% since I bought my shares\\xa0in 2018. (The stock is up 800%.)The company has moved from gross deals like one with (womp womp!)\\xa0Amazon\\xa0(NASDAQ:AMZN) to\\xa0industry-specific offerings\\xa0sold through\\xa0case studies on early customers. It’s the kind of beneath-the-radar selling\\xa0International Business Machines\\xa0(NYSE:IBM) did in the 20th century, when it was the business computing leader.The fate of IBM, now worth 2% of Microsoft with about one-quarter of its sales, should keep Microsoft people paranoid. Microsoft doesn’t have nearly the pre-eminence “Big Blue” did when I started covering technology 40 years ago. What was a monopoly then is an oligopoly now, engaged in “coopetition.” Microsoft is ready to cooperate with Apple on its\\xa0Vision Pro\\xa0and sell Co-Pilot seats to Amazon while slurping data from\\xa0Alphabet’s\\xa0(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)\\xa0Chrome. This is an era of Cloud “Czars,” not a single Cloud Czar.It’s a world where consumers, businesses, and governments are just starting to get their arms around. It’s the reason the U.S. economy is as dominant as it has ever been. How long can the good times roll?Nothing grows straight up. The post-earnings fall of Microsoft and the other winners of the Cloud Wars was welcome, given stretched valuations.I expect some follow-through over the next few months. The Federal Reserve will continue to\\xa0disappoint. The globe will continue to\\xa0simmer with war.\\xa0Political uncertainty will rise through the end of the year. There will be many predictions of\\xa0imminent doom.Watch Microsoft carefully and accumulate it on weakness.As of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn has had LONG positions in AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and AAPL.

       "  'You may have heard the slogan, \"This, not that.\" The mantra encourages people to think about their decisions. Something popular might not benefit you, so consider a similar, better alternative.It\\'s a fun game that came to mind when thinking about some of Warren Buffett\\'s investments, which are held in Berkshire Hathaway, his holding company. Some of Berkshire\\'s most significant and best-performing stocks aren\\'t always right for everyone. Fortunately, you don\\'t need to go off the beaten path to find that good alternative.Here are two trillion-dollar companies that Berkshire owns. One is a screaming buy today, while the other is best for investors to avoid -- at least, for now.Though it\\'s not a massive position at just 0.4%, e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a holding of Berkshire Hathaway since 2019. Most people are familiar with Amazon\\'s e-commerce business, which dominates the U.S. with a 38% market share. Some may also know that Amazon\\'s cloud platform, AWS, is the global leader, with roughly a third of the worldwide market. Even fewer likely know that Amazon is quickly becoming an advertising powerhouse.What should attract buyers to the stock today is a valuation that\\'s sneakily attractive even as the stock trades near its highest price in a year. Amazon\\'s business has many moving parts, and e-commerce requires investments to expand to accommodate growth.So I like looking at Amazon\\'s operating cash flow (revenue minus expenses from running the company) to understand how much of a bargain the stock is. Comparing its price to its operating cash flow per share, you\\'ll see that the stock is near its cheapest valuation in a decade:That\\'s a great launch pad for future investment returns. After all, e-commerce and cloud computing are massive industries that should still have many years of growth ahead.Being a market leader, Amazon will almost surely capture a solid piece of these growth trends over the coming years. Analysts believe that could translate to annualized long-term earnings growth averaging 24%. This setup makes Amazon a \"Magnificent Seven\" stock you can continue buying confidently.Seeing iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) here might be jarring. After all, it\\'s Berkshire\\'s largest stock investment by a wide margin, nearly half of its entire portfolio. Buffett himself has even called Apple the best business Berkshire owns. But this ultimately boils down to timing. Apple is undeniably one of the world\\'s most significant financial and cultural companies. People, myself included, love their iOS devices.But the company has gotten so big that growth is getting harder. Apple\\'s revenue growth has slowed dramatically in recent years since it brought 5G iPhones to market. There doesn\\'t seem to be a big motivator for many consumers to switch as often, and there are already over 2 billion active iOS devices worldwide. Naturally, slowing revenue growth has caused analysts to continue lowering their long-term expectations for earnings.Ironically, the stock continues to thrive. Shares are at all-time highs, and the stock\\'s valuation has increased to over 28 times estimated 2024 earnings. The risk to new buyers is that sentiment might cool on the stock if Apple can\\'t increase the growth to justify such a lofty price tag. Its current PEG ratio is roughly 3, indicating that shares are pretty pricey for their expected growth. I like to see this ratio under 1.5.Those who own the stock can feel free to hold it because Apple is a remarkable company. It\\'s just run high enough that new buyers may find better alternatives like Amazon. The stock will again be a fantastic buy-and-hold idea once the valuation makes more sense.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn\\'t one of them.

It has a starting price tag of $3,499.99.\"We are seeing strong excitement in Enterprise,\" Maestri said on Thursday about the Vision Pro. \"Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as their new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees.\"APPLE QUARTERLY PROFIT, REVENUE TOP WALL STREET TARGETS BUT CHINA LAGSCook told those tuning into Apple’s first-quarter earnings call he had seen several demos from companies, including a merchandising app from Walmart that he described as \"very cool.\"READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\"There are firms that are doing design collaboration apps.

       "  'Warren Buffett\\'s investing track record is tough to match. Since taking over as CEO and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, he took the struggling textile company and turned it into a massive conglomerate. The share value increased from $18 then to around $580,000 today. That computes to an eye-popping cumulative return of over 3,200,000% and a compound annual growth rate of about 19.4% for the last 58.5 years.Much of that growth is fueled by Buffett\\'s expansion into the insurance industry and using the float provided by insurance premiums to invest in an equity portfolio (or fully purchasing businesses). So, when Buffett makes a buy or sell decision, the whole investing world pays attention. And there\\'s one stock Buffett has been buying much more than any of the others in Berkshire\\'s portfolio over the last five years.Buffett and his team manage a massive $373 billion portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway is required to report its U.S. holdings at the end of every quarter by filing form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, the conglomerate must report any stock purchases or sales for companies in which it owns a stake of 10% or more within three days of the trade. That gives investors a lot of insight into what Buffett\\'s buying and selling for Berkshire.As of its most recent reports, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is by far the biggest holding in Berkshire\\'s portfolio. The iPhone maker accounts for nearly half of the entire portfolio value. And Buffett hasn\\'t been shy about how much he likes Apple. \"It\\'s better than any business we own,\" he told shareholders at their annual meeting last May.Buffett has consistently added to Berkshire\\'s position in Apple since its initial investment in 2016.\\xa0There were a few times when Berkshire some shares for tax purposes, but Buffett later called those decisions a mistake.While Berkshire\\'s stake in Apple is worth around $173 billion, Buffett and his team likely spent around $40 billion establishing that position. That\\'s a massive buy for sure, and it shows Buffett is very willing to put his money where his mouth is.Despite the heavy weighting in Berkshire\\'s portfolio, Buffett continues to occasionally buy more Apple shares. The most recent purchase was in the first quarter of last year.Another stock Buffett\\'s been piling cash into lately is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Berkshire Hathaway initially took a stake in Occidental by providing $10 billion in capital in exchange for 100,000 preferred shares paying an 8% dividend. Occidental used the capital to fund its purchase of Anadarko.At the start of 2022, Buffett began building a position in Occidental\\'s common stock. It\\'s been one of his favorite stocks to buy over the past two years as he\\'s grown Berkshire\\'s stake in the company to nearly 28%. Establishing that position cost about $13.5 billion, so the total investment since 2019 has been about $23.5 billion. That said, Occidental has started redeeming some of Berkshire\\'s preferred shares, buying back about $1.5 billion through the third quarter of last year.While Apple and Occidental have been two of Buffett\\'s biggest investments lately, neither comes close to the amount he\\'s put into buying shares of his favorite stock. And investors won\\'t find it on form 13F. They\\'ll have to look at Berkshire\\'s quarterly reports.Over the last five years, Buffett\\'s spent about $75 billion buying one stock in particular. But the value of those stock purchases doesn\\'t show up in Berkshire\\'s portfolio. Nonetheless, shareholders, in aggregate, are at least $75 billion wealthier as a result.The stock Warren Buffett\\'s been buying up like no other is, in fact, Berkshire Hathaway itself.Berkshire Hathaway\\'s share repurchase policy underwent a significant change in mid-2018. Previously, Buffett would only buy back shares of Berkshire if it fell below 120% of book value. However, that didn\\'t present very many opportunities to buy back stock and proved to be overly restrictive.The board changed the policy in mid-2018 to allow Buffett to buy shares whenever he and Charlie Munger determined the stock price was below Berkshire\\'s intrinsic value, so long as the company kept at least $20 billion in cash and Treasuries on its balance sheet.Since then, Buffett has gone on to repurchase shares of Berkshire Hathaway every quarter. He was especially active in buying shares in 2020 and 2021. With a whopping $157 billion in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet and a business generating billions in free cash flow every quarter, there\\'s a very good chance Buffett will keep buying back Berkshire stock going forward.Berkshire Hathaway shareholders benefit from Buffett\\'s share buybacks. As Buffett reduces the number of shares outstanding, the stake of existing shareholders in Berkshire\\'s future earnings increases. As a result, the buybacks support the company\\'s earnings per share, which is one of the biggest determinants of its stock price. Additionally, Buffett\\'s willingness to deploy extra cash toward buybacks means there\\'s a big buyer willing to step in if the stock price declines, which should\\xa0prevent the price from ever falling too far.Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\\'t one of them.

       "  \"(Bloomberg) -- The Magnificent Seven group of megacap tech stocks need to deliver stellar earnings to keep outperforming the broader market, according to a growing consensus on Wall Street.Most Read from BloombergWhy NYC Apartment Buildings Are on Sale Now for 50% OffPowell Tells ‘60 Minutes’ Fed Is Wary of Cutting Rates Too SoonMusk Took Drugs With Some Tesla Board Members, WSJ SaysEastern Europe’s Richest Woman Pivots $43 Billion Empire WestElon's Cage Fight With Zuckerberg Just Happened. He LostThe group — comprised of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — doubled in value in 2023, outperforming the broader Nasdaq 100 Index’s 54% rise. The majority extended gains this year — with the exception of Tesla and Apple.Optimism about a stronger-than-expected economy, peaking interest rates and artificial intelligence have helped bolster the stocks. Investors are now questioning if gains can be sustained through 2024 and if the grouping of seven will remain intact as their performances differentiate. Tesla has dropped 24% this year, while Meta is up 34%. The Facebook parent on Friday saw the biggest single-session market value gain in history.“As the Dot Com boom showed, continued outperformance requires stocks to exceed the high bar set by consensus,” a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. team led by David Kostin said. “The “fate of the magnificent 7 stocks depends on their ability to deliver rapid revenue growth in 2024,” he wrote.The strategists noted a wide dispersion of consensus growth estimates across the group. That’s highlighted by varying degrees of revenue expectations for this year. While Nvidia’s revenue is expected to soar 119% from a year prior, Alphabet’s is seen dropping 7%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Others suggest a more selective approach to Magnificent Seven allocation. Berenberg strategists prefer to be exposed to some of these stocks, but not all of them, especially as the US technology sectors’ valuations are lofty versus global peers, providing a sell signal.“Overall, the Mag7 group retains earnings momentum leadership relative to the S&P 493,” they wrote in a note. “The group needs to maintain this momentum to outperform again in 2024.”The reporting season has been mixed. Meta and Amazon delivered quarterly earnings and outlooks that far exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Microsoft posted its strongest revenue growth since 2022.Apple returned to revenue growth but demand in China was weaker than feared. Tesla’s recent performance meanwhile has stoked debate as to whether it can maintain its place in the group, amid warnings of plunging demand for EVs and the impact of price cuts on margins. Nvidia is expected to report later this month.To be sure, there are concerns about the increasing dominance of a small number of stocks. JPMorgan Chase & Co. quantitative strategists last week noted this is drawing similarities with the dot-com bubble, raising the risk of a selloff. The likelihood of the broader index outperforming the top ten stocks in the near future is becoming increasingly likely, they said.Still, Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson recently listed Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia among a screen of high-quality growth stocks that have overweight ratings from the bank’s analysts. He said such shares can continue outperforming amid strong earnings revisions.“We see a relative performance catch up to strong relative earnings revisions and note that the cohort can outperform in all three macro scenarios we have laid out for 2024,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin AmericaBloomberg New Economy Is Looking for World-Changing Leaders Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion PaydayMano dura de El Salvador contra el crimen seduce a América LatinaChinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\"],\n",

It\\'s evolve or die in this new role — risk clinging to the past and its myriad of practices, or embrace the future and crush it.The same could be applied to investors at this very moment in time.Evolve your thinking around the \"Magnificent Seven\" trade that has brought you immense paper profits the past year, or else get your portfolio blown up in the not-too-distant future.Am I being too harsh? Maybe, but I need to be because I truly feel that investors have forgotten there are more ways to make money than hitting the buy button on seven tech stocks. And with their blinders on, they are overlooking new trends, news, and information that warrant a short-term pause on the explosive Magnificent Seven trade.The first thing that is fresh to the scene is an updated market narrative.If late 2023 was all about interest rate cuts in an election year, then the first half of 2024 is shaping up to be about the potential for next to no rate cuts this year.Headline job creation of 353,000 for January and big upward revisions for job gains in November and December signal an economy doing pretty darn well. It\\'s an economy that in no way needs a rate cut this spring. An economy so strong as to justify a more hawkish Fed.\"Forget the anecdotal signs of tech layoffs and companies going for efficiency this year, the economy is producing hundreds of thousands of new jobs,\" FWDBONDS chief economist Chris Rupkey wrote in a client note.\"Fed officials are going to have to sharpen their pencils on the timing of any interest rate cuts this year because higher rates are sure not slowing the economy down.\"In short, the incoming data from the last two weeks suggests no rate cuts are imminent — and that removes a key tailwind that powered market psychology (and inflated trading multiples) around Magnificent Seven stocks.Secondarily, there are the fundamentals of these tech behemoths as seen on their recent earnings days.I\\'m not sure about you, but I haven\\'t been blown away by the results from Magnificent Seven stalwarts Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla. All of these reports had warts that should call into question trading multiples on them. Apple\\'s performance in China was weak. The March quarter guidance was weak. iPhone sales didn\\'t wow.As for Alphabet, it missed on cloud sales. Tesla\\'s quarter and the Elon Musk-led earnings call was littered with red flags.Microsoft\\'s quarter poked a hole in the narrative — for now — that all its new AI is going to lead to a massive reappraisal of its earnings estimates by the Street in 2024. Stripping out the announcement of its first-ever dividend, Meta\\'s quarter was reasonable — but it also jacked up its 2024 capex a ton.Amazon\\'s quarter was the lone rockstar through and through. Accelerating sales out of AWS, impressive operating margin expansion, and a killer guidance.Take all of this new info together and the message should be clear to investors: Evolve your thinking on the Magnificent Seven, or else.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance\\'s Executive Editor.

The market wasn’t particularly impressed with the Alphabet and Apple reports, but they came out with Q4 earnings growth of +51.8% and +13.1%, respectively.Tesla’s earnings were down -45.8% in Q3 on +3.5% higher revenues, as the EV-maker continued to grapple with weakening margins in an increasingly competitive EV market.Using estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its December-quarter results on February 21st, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +48.7% from the same period last year on +14.5% higher revenues.Please note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 28.6% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 19.5% of the index’s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 23.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.Given their enormous earnings power and growth profiles, it is hard to argue with the group’s market leadership. Importantly, analysts had been raising their estimates for the group even before the December-quarter results, with these numbers now adding to the positive revision momentum.Beyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues.This week’s blockbuster Tech results has pushed the aggregate earnings growth picture for the S&P 500 index to +4.3% from last week’s +1.1% growth pace. Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 stocks, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -4.2%.Including all the results that came out through Friday, February 2nd, we now have Q4 results from 230 S&P 500 members, or 46% of the index’s total membership.We have more than 500 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. This week’s line-up includes a who’s who of the index, including Disney, Elli Lilly, MacDonalds, DuPont, Caterpillar, Ford, Pepsi, Chipotle, Uber, PayPal, Expedia, and many others.Total Q4 earnings for the 230 index members that have reported already are up +4.2% from the same period last year on +2.8% higher revenues, with 81.3% beating EPS estimates and 63.9% beating revenue estimates.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Earnings: Tech Flexes Strong Growth Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P\\'s +6.2 average gain per year.

       "  \"Chicago, IL – February 5, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Meta Platforms META.We saw a slew of earnings this week from the market’s leading stocks, and they didn’t disappoint. In addition to many other companies that reported earnings, five of the ‘Magnificent 7’ informed us of their performance.Last Tuesday, we heard from Microsoft and Alphabet, and then on Thursday afternoon from Amazon, Apple and Meta Platforms.All these market leading companies have put up incredible stock performance over the last 18 months, and it looks like that trend may well continue. In this article we are going to take a look at the quarterly earnings reports, valuations, and Zacks Ranks, and attempt to identify which are the most attractive investments right now.Microsoft: Q2 2024 saw Microsoft soar past expectations with 18% revenue growth and a 33% EPS jump. Their cloud product, Azure, fueled the gain with a 30% surge and doubled its AI integration showcasing commitment to the future. However, a lower-than-expected Q3 revenue forecast was a notable concern. Despite this, Microsoft remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its thriving cloud business and dedication to AI advancements.Alphabet: While Q4 2023 earnings for Alphabet topped EPS estimates by 2%, ad revenue missed expectations slightly, leading to a stock price dip despite an overall 14% YoY sales growth. Their cloud business continues to shine, but concerns linger about growth in the core advertising engine. With a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold), may be a bit less appealing based on earnings estimate trends.Amazon: Q4 2023 earnings were music to investors' ears with Amazon exceeding estimates on both revenue and EPS. Their cloud computing arm, AWS, continues to be a major growth driver, and advertising revenue also surpassed expectations. This positive report led to a stock price rise and solidified Amazon's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.Apple: Q1 2024 earnings saw Apple beat analyst expectations for both revenue and EPS. Revenue grew 2% YoY to $119.6 billion, and EPS increased 16% YoY to $2.18. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, Services revenue reached an all-time high, suggesting a shift towards recurring income streams. The company also achieved a record number of active devices. Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.Meta Platforms: Q4 2023 earnings surpassed expectations, leading to a more than 20% surge in stock price. Both revenue and EPS beat analyst estimates, with revenue growing 25% YoY. The company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend and a $50 billion stock buyback, further contributing to investor excitement. Metaverse investment continues, and its profitability remains a concern for some investors. META has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.The chart below shows the forward earnings multiples of each of the stocks discussed in this article. We can see that GOOGL and META have the lowest, near 20x, and AMZN has the highest at 43.5x.AAPL and MSFT are in the middle of the pack with 28.4x and 36.2x respectively.It is also worth noting that AMZN, META and GOOGL are all below their 10-year median valuations, while AAPL and MSFT are above them.I think Meta Platforms and Amazon are showing the most promise for further big moves ahead. Amazon’s development is just so impressive to me, with AWS still growing at 20%, and their new advertising business growing at 23% annually and suddenly bringing in $60 billion in sales annually.The success in ads is even more impressive when compared to Alphabet, the leading online ad platforms, whose growth is slowing significantly.Meta Platforms too is just absolutely killing it. Even with its 250% rally in the last year and a half it still trades at a very reasonable earnings multiple. And now with its new $50 billion buyback plan, and a new dividend, it is showing a real commitment to returning cash to shareholders.Alphabet, although it has some concerning growth data regarding its ad business, does continue to chug along. I don’t think it has the best growth prospects, but there is no doubt it is the cheapest of the Magnificent 7, which makes it a worthy investment consideration.Apple and Microsoft are of course fantastic businesses that should be a part of any well diversified investment portfolio, but I think at this point in time are less appealing than the other three. Apple is seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales growth, and Microsoft seems to have a lot of future news priced in especially regarding its recent gains with AI. The premium valuations are a concern as well.Nonetheless, this group of the world’s leading companies have shown that even at their mammoth sizes, they continue to thrive. Furthermore, they are showing that the US economy is still performing at a steady rate.Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

       "  'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-closing-100600802.html',\n",
       "  '2024-02-05 04:06:00',\n",
       "  \"For nearly 60 years, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been putting on a clinic for Wall Street and everyday investors. Since becoming Berkshire's leader in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a phenomenal 4,700,010% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on Feb. 1, 2024.What's great about the Oracle of Omaha's tenure as CEO is there are few secrets. Though he's not going to divulge what he and his investment team are buying ahead of time, he's proven more than willing to share his investment philosophy and thoughts on the U.S. economy over the years. In particular, Buffett is a big fan of buying stakes in brand-name businesses with sustainable competitive edges.Even factoring in down years, Buffett and his investing aides have led Berkshire Hathaway to a nearly 20% annualized return over roughly six decades. That's nearly double the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500.More importantly, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is closing in on history. As of the closing bell on Feb. 1, it was less than $162 billion in market cap away from joining a very select group of publicly traded companies to have reached the $1 trillion valuation mark. This club currently includes:Microsoft: $3 trillionApple (NASDAQ: AAPL): $2.89 trillionAlphabet: $1.77 trillion (Class A shares, GOOGL)Amazon: $1.65 trillionMeta Platforms: $1.01 trillionElectric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla also previously joined the trillion-dollar ranks, but has lost more than 50% of its value since reaching an all-time high. That's just six publicly traded companies out of thousands of major exchange-listed businesses that have reached the trillion-dollar plateau. Berkshire finds itself less than a 20% gain away from becoming lucky No. 7.A big reason Berkshire Hathaway continues to outperform most years is its highly concentrated investment portfolio. Despite having stakes in around 50 stocks, Buffett and his team strongly believe in putting an outsized percentage of their capital to work in their best investment ideas. Many of these top ideas have outperformed the broader market.For instance, Apple accounts for a 46% share of Berkshire's $372 billion investment portfolio, as of February 1. Buffett and his investing team have put in the neighborhood of $36.3 billion to work in shares of Apple since the first quarter of 2016. This sizable bet on Apple has resulted in an unrealized gain of almost $135 billion. Betting on Apple's incredibly strong brand, as well as its leading innovation via the iPhone and its burgeoning Services segment, has proved to be an incredibly smart move.Another catalyst for Berkshire's ongoing success is that its investment portfolio and the roughly five dozen businesses it's acquired over the years -- this includes famous insurer GEICO and prominent railroad BNSF -- are primarily cyclical. In other words, they tend to ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. economy.Warren Buffett and his late right-hand man Charlie Munger learned a long time ago that it's a fool's errand to attempt to guess when downturns will occur in the U.S. economy and stock market. Rather, they positioned Berkshire's investment portfolio and the company's owned assets to take advantage of long-winded periods of expansion. Since recessions are historically short-lived, patience has allowed Berkshire Hathaway to thrive.To add to the above, Buffett's company tends to hang onto its largest investments for a long time. For instance, Coca-Cola and American Express have been continuous holdings since 1988 and 1991, respectively. You could argue that doing nothing was the best decision Warren Buffett and his team ever made.But in spite of more than a half-century of outperformance and an investment portfolio that's intricately pinned to the health of the U.S. economy, I'm not convinced that 2024 is the year we'll see Berkshire Hathaway join this exclusive club.One potential hurdle for Berkshire Hathaway's stock is the possibility of a U.S. recession taking place. Although economic data points are strong at the moment, a couple of predictive indicators and money-based metrics tell a different story. Specifically, the first decline in M2 money supply since the Great Depression, coupled with an assortment of recession-predicting tools, suggest an economic downturn is likely.Considering how cyclical most of Berkshire's investments and owned assets are, Buffett's company is prone to weakness during short-lived periods of contraction.However, the biggest threat to Berkshire Hathaway gaining a tad over 27% during 2024 and joining the exclusive trillion-dollar club is a rotten Apple.Everything I noted earlier about Apple is true. It's been a leader in smartphone market share in the U.S. for more than a decade and has seen strong sales growth from its Services segment as CEO Tim Cook emphasizes high-margin subscription services. There's little question that Apple is going to remain profitable.However, Apple's outsized returns have historically come on the heels of strong growth (think high-single-digit or low-double-digit annual sales increases). In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30, 2023), Apple's year-over-year revenue fell by nearly 3%. During the fiscal first quarter of 2024 (ended Dec. 30), revenue growth totaled just 2%. Even with above-average inflation as a tailwind, muted demand for its physical products, along with weaker sales in China, have heavily weighed on its operating performance.Though Berkshire Hathaway can fall back on its roughly five dozen wholly owned assets that have steadily increased the company's operating income over time, overcoming a poor year from an investment that accounts for close to half of the company's invested assets could be too big of a pill to swallow.I have no doubts that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway will eventually join elite company and become a trillion-dollar business. But I fully expect a single rotten Apple to spoil the dream -- at least in 2024.Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

       "  'Huawei Technologies climbed back to the No 1 spot of China\\'s smartphone market in the initial two weeks of this year, according to a report by research firm Counterpoint, putting more pressure on 2023 industry leader Apple and major mainland rivals in the world\\'s largest handset market.This marks the first time Huawei reclaimed the top smartphone sales ranking on the mainland since Washington imposed sanctions on the Shenzhen-based company when it was added to the US trade blacklist in May 2019, which crippled the firm\\'s once-lucrative handset business, according to the report on Sunday by Counterpoint research analysts Ivan Lam and Zhang Mengmeng.That resurgence was jump-started by Huawei\\'s surprise release last August of its Mate 60 Pro 5G smartphone - powered by its advanced Kirin 9000S processor, which was locally developed in spite of US tech sanctions - as well as the firm\\'s Android replacement mobile platform HarmonyOS, the report said. It also pointed out that brand loyalty among Chinese consumers greatly contributed to the popularity of Huawei\\'s new 5G handsets.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.The Counterpoint report, however, indicated that Huawei still faced cutthroat competition on the mainland against Apple and major domestic handset vendors that include Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo, which continue to launch high-end smartphone models.A shopper holds up two display units of Huawei Technologies\\' 5G Mate 60 Pro smartphone at an electronics store in Xian, capital of northwestern Shaanxi province, on September 9, 2023. Photo: Shutterstock alt=A shopper holds up two display units of Huawei Technologies\\' 5G Mate 60 Pro smartphone at an electronics store in Xian, capital of northwestern Shaanxi province, on September 9, 2023. Photo: Shutterstock>Robust domestic demand for Huawei\\'s new 5G smartphone models, years after its release of the Mate 40 series in October 2020, reflect improved consumer appetite for handset upgrades amid Beijing\\'s efforts to ease mounting pressure from debt, deflation and weak confidence.China\\'s smartphone industry showed signs of recovery in 2023, when shipments grew 6.5 per cent year on year to 289 million units, according to data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology. Domestic brands made up 231 million units, or around 80 per cent, of total shipments.The mainland\\'s high-end handset segment sales also grew 37 per cent last year, despite overall weakness in the global smartphone industry, Counterpoint data showed. While Apple led that market segment in the country in the first half of last year, the iPhone maker\\'s sales started to get squeezed in the third quarter amid a strong push by Chinese vendors led by HuaweiThe rise of Huawei smartphone sales on the mainland early this year, followed a decline in iPhone sales in the fourth quarter.Apple, however, still ranked as mainland China\\'s leading smartphone vendor in the fourth quarter and the whole of last year, according to a report by tech research firm IDC.Last week, Apple reported a nearly 13 per cent drop in revenue from its Greater China region - covering the mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan - in the December quarter, while sales rose in its other operating regions.Apple\\'s weekly smartphone shipments in China have declined by 30 to 40 per cent in recent weeks, according to a recent research note by Kuo Ming-chi, a TF International Securities analyst known for his accurate assessment of Apple\\'s business. Kuo expected this downward trend to continue this year.\"The main reason for the decline is the return of Huawei and the fact that foldable phones have gradually become the first choice for high-end users in the Chinese market,\" Kuo wrote in the note.The global premium smartphone market, where handsets are priced from US$600, saw Apple remain the \"undisputed leader\" last year with a dominant 71 per cent share, according to a Counterpoint report last month.Still, Apple\\'s share in that segment was down from 75 per cent in 2022 amid the resurgence of Huawei on the mainland and the gains made by Samsung Electronics, the report said.In a rare move, Apple last month offered Chinese consumers discounts of up to 800 yuan (US$113) on a range of products, from iPhones to MacBooks, ahead of the Lunar New Year to fend off competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Honor, which also cut their handset prices.Huawei, however, did not pursue a similar strategy, as it faced a supply shortage of its Mate 60 Pro owing to production constraints.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

       "  '(Recasts, adds context on the sector, details on January performance from paragraph 2)TAIPEI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Taiwan\\'s Foxconn, the world\\'s largest contract electronics maker and Apple\\'s biggest iPhone assembler, on Monday reiterated that it expected an on-year drop in first quarter revenue coming off a high base.The first quarter is traditionally quieter than the previous one, the season when Taiwan\\'s tech companies race to supply smartphones, tablets and other electronics to major vendors such as Apple for Western markets\\' year-end holiday period.Foxconn said in a statement that overall operations in this year\\'s first quarter were \"gradually entering the traditional off-peak season, and seasonal performance is expected to be similar to that of the past three years\".It noted that in the first quarter of 2023, as factories resumed normal operations following the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing shipments led to a higher comparison base.\"The outlook for the first quarter of this year is expected to decrease year-on-year,\" Foxconn said, reiterating previous guidance.The company does not give numerical forecasts.Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said revenue last month reached T$522.1 billion ($16.65 billion), which it said was the second-highest ever for the same period, the highest being the previous January.That was up 13.5% month-on-month, but down 20.9% year-on-year.Compared to the year-ago period, it said in January revenue for cloud and networking products increased significantly due to new customer product launches, but with personal computer demand slowing revenue fell slightly for computing products.Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way said on Sunday he expects the company\\'s business this year to be \"slightly better\" than last year but is facing a shortage of chips for AI servers, where demand is booming.Foxconn will report fourth quarter earnings on March 14, when it will also update its outlook.Foxconn\\'s shares closed down 0.5% on Monday ahead of the release of its January numbers, compared with a 0.2% gain for the broader market.

       "  \"In this article, we will take a look at 15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens. You can skip our detailed analysis of methods of obtaining second passport as well as a look at the US MNCs in the European market and go directly to the 5 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens. In this ever-expanding world of opportunities, the idea of second passports has been hailed as a harbinger of many benefits, both economic and social. Whether it is a desire to live and experience the gems and natural wonders of this world, incentives for a higher quality of life, or even financial diversification, there is something for everyone here. About half a century ago, the concept of a second passport or dual citizenship was unfathomable and highly disliked by almost all countries. However, with time and advancement, the significance of a free flow of residents between countries has been acknowledged, and a more tolerant view has emerged as a consequence. Thus, we can now find various easy countries for a second passport for U.S. citizens.As is the case with almost everything, there are both advantages and disadvantages to acquiring and maintaining a second passport. However, with the increasing trend towards dual citizenship, it appears that the benefits far outweigh the negative aspects. The perks include, but are not limited to, access to global travel, better social and economic benefits, more business and job opportunities, and certain tax reliefs. For a detailed analysis of dual citizenship advantages and disadvantages, check out our article on Dual Citizenship: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Requirements. Thus, the appeal of obtaining a second passport can be understood, and the search for the easiest countries to achieve this, is justified.The growing demand for a second passport has prompted many people, especially the rich, to relocate to various countries around the globe. According to a recent estimate from the State Department, approximately 9 million Americans are living abroad. It is observed that 40% of US residents abroad choose to move to the Western Hemisphere, which includes Canada, Central, and South America. Additionally, 26% move to Europe, 14% to East Asia and the Pacific, and another 14% to the Middle East. Many prominent US entrepreneurs have made headlines with news of their foreign citizenship. Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, has acquired Indonesia’s Golden Visa. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), chose Cyprus’s Golden Visa, and billionaire Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) and an early investor in Facebook-- Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), obtained New Zealand’s citizenship in 2011. Therefore, it is evident that there are countries where US residents can gain a second passport with ease.To acquire a second passport, there are primarily four paths to follow: citizenship through birth/descent, citizenship through marriage, citizenship through investment, and citizenship through a residency-by-investment program or naturalization. Citizenship through birth/descent is attained by being born to parents with citizenship, automatically granting the same for the child. Proof of an ancestral connection with a citizen can also lead to citizenship. Citizenship through investment is mainly acquired by making an economic investment in the country. Naturalization is a process through which citizenship can be achieved by gaining residency in a country, often through investment, and building a relationship with the country by spending a specified time there. Alternatively, citizenship can be granted by marrying a citizen of a country. Thus, depending on the method employed, there are many countries where US residents can access a second passport.European markets stand among the largest global economies. With an increasing influx of emigrants to these states, it's no surprise that more companies are expanding their operations there. Thirty percent of US companies move to Europe to achieve their profit goals, and thirty-two percent even introduce new products to tap into this burgeoning market.Ireland’s economy, in particular, has experienced a staggering positive impact from multinationals in 2022. These companies contributed 56% to the total value added, including giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook-- Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), and Google-- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG). Notably, sectors such as information and communication, dominated by MNCs like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ: META), and Google-- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), witnessed the most significant expansion.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) is actively expanding its operations in the European market, as indicated by recent developments. In October 2023, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), secured unconditional EU anti-trust approval for its $43 billion acquisition of cancer drug maker Seagen (SGEN.O).Similarly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is making strategic moves to maintain a strong presence in the European market. On December 13, 2023, the company announced the expansion of its Self Service Repair program, now covering the iPhone 15 lineup and Mac models powered by M2 chips.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) also confirmed the availability of this Self Service Repair program in 24 additional European countries, such as Croatia, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Switzerland.15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US CitizensTo create our list of the easiest countries for a second passport for US citizens, we conducted extensive research on the best and most straightforward options available. We also referred to our article from the previous year, highlighting the 15 Easiest Countries to Get Citizenship as an American. Additionally, we cross-referenced our findings with ImmigrantInvest.com’s list of countries that permit dual citizenship for US citizens. Our comprehensive approach considered various methods for obtaining dual citizenship, encompassing citizenship by descent, residency, naturalization through investment programs, and citizenship by investment programs. We made sure to include countries from diverse regions, spanning Latin America, Asia and the South Pacific, Europe, and the Caribbean Islands.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.Now that we have thoroughly combed our sources and selected the easiest countries for second passport for US citizens, we present it to you in an ascending list:In the Asia and South Pacific region, numerous countries offer citizenship through various means. Considering the countries that permit dual citizenship for US residents and the fact that New Zealand falls under the category of the easiest countries to obtain citizenship through descent, we have placed this country at number 15 on our list.Considered one of the most affordable and expedient methods to acquire a second passport, gaining citizenship in New Zealand is remarkably straightforward. If one of the parents is a citizen of New Zealand, the child can easily obtain citizenship by submitting an application, with the process typically taking about 30 working days. For those seeking an even faster turnaround, a reduced processing time of 10 days is available for an additional fee. New Zealand, being a developed country, ensures a high quality of life for its residents. Acquiring dual citizenship from this nation can prove to be a beneficial option for many Americans.Italy, being one of the European countries, stands out as one of the easiest nations to obtain citizenship for US residents through descent. All that is required is proof of Italian descent, with a birth certificate of oneself and one's parents, grandparents, or any direct ancestor typically considered sufficient. Other acceptable documents may include death certificates, divorce or marriage certificates. However, two conditions must be met: the ancestor acquired citizenship before June 14, 1912, and this citizenship had not been renounced or replaced by a second citizenship before the birth of their child.Situated in the Caribbean, this picturesque island is a favored destination for US residents. It not only provides the chance to enjoy natural marvels but also offers opportunities for financial gains through multiple tax advantages. The St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship-by-investment program stands out as one of the easiest and quickest ways for US citizens to obtain a second passport. The program doesn't require any mandatory stay period in the country, and the immigration process is completed in just four months. The primary requirement is a $250,000 payment to the Sustainable Island State Contribution (SISC).Similar to St. Kitts and Nevis, another Caribbean island stands out as one of the easiest options for obtaining a second passport for US citizens. The St. Lucia investment program is particularly cost-effective, requiring a contribution of $100,000 to St. Lucia’s Government Development Fund as the minimum investment. While this figure applies for a single person, a slightly higher amount for a spouse or children allows the qualified US resident to secure dual citizenship for themselves and their family in just three months.In the Pacific region, Vanuatu takes the lead by offering the only citizenship-by-investment program. Individuals, including US residents, can acquire citizenship by investing $130,000. Beyond the relatively low investment requirement, the most significant advantage lies in the expeditious process, which can be completed in approximately 2 months. Vanuatu not only offers various tax benefits, including no income tax, inheritance tax, or capital gains tax but also provides a straightforward and easy pathway for gaining a second passport for US residents.Ireland is a popular destination for immigration, particularly through the Descent Program. The Irish government has made this process highly accessible, allowing individuals to qualify for citizenship rights by establishing an ancestral connection up to the great-grandfather. Additionally, other familial ties, such as marriage to an Irish citizen, provide an opportunity for citizenship, with the requirement of spending at least three years with the said spouse or partner. Although this period may seem relatively long, it is shorter compared to Portugal or Switzerland. Therefore, Ireland stands out as one of the easiest countries for obtaining a second passport for US citizens.Close to the US, Canada is considered one of the easiest countries for US residents to apply for obtaining dual citizenship. Known for its welcoming environment, Canada boasts a straightforward immigration process. While US citizens don't require a visa for stays less than 180 days, a visa or residency permit is needed for longer stays.While the Quebec Investor Program is an option, the easiest route is through the Express Entry System. Under this program, individuals skilled in three major economic fields in Canada are evaluated using a point system. The higher the points, the greater the likelihood of obtaining a visa. Subsequently, a stay of at least three years or 1095 days out of 5 years would lead to citizenship. Other conditions include passing tests related to Canadian history and language (English or French) as well as fulfilling any necessary tax obligations.This European country is renowned as one of the easiest nations providing citizenship through a residency-by-investment program. The Golden Visa allows an individual to acquire residency rights within three months, with an investment of at least €300,000. This residency can eventually lead to citizenship in approximately seven years, provided essential government requirements are met. These include maintaining the investment and residency for seven years, adhering to the required time period for staying in the country, and visiting Cyprus at least once every two years.The Caribbean Islands continue to offer some of the easiest paths for obtaining a second passport for US residents, with Antigua and Barbuda emerging as a prominent option. Notably, this stunning island stands out due to its low investment amount ($100,000) and a quick and hassle-free process. In contrast to many countries that increase the initial investment amount with the introduction of more family members, Antigua and Barbuda includes a spouse and two children in the same figure, with additional cost only on the form of fees. There are three ways to make the investment, and citizenship can be obtained in about three to four months. However, the country requires a presence of five days a year for passport renewal.Grenada secures the 6th position on our list of the easiest countries for a second passport for US citizens, primarily due to the speed with which citizenship can be achieved. The country's citizenship-by-investment program stands out as one of the best in the Caribbean Islands. With a minimum investment through a donation of $150,000 for a single person (which increases to $200,000 and additional fees for a family of four), a qualifying investor can attain citizenship within three to six months.Click to continue reading and see our 5 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens.Suggested Articles: 24 Countries Where You Can Retire on Just Social Security in 202415 Countries With Highest Mortgage Rates12 Most Innovative Economies in EuropeDisclosure: None. 15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens is originally published on Insider Monkey.\"],\n",

       "  \"Many people believe that Warren Buffett is the greatest investor ever. As the longtime CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, he has held many winning investments.Perhaps his most successful is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The conglomerate first started buying shares in the iPhone maker during the first quarter of 2016. And since the start of that year, shares have skyrocketed an incredible 615%.A whopping 45.7% of Berkshire's entire portfolio is represented by just Apple. With such a high weighting, coupled with a market cap of $2.9 trillion and a price-to-earning (P/E) ratio of 30.4, it forces one to wonder why the Oracle of Omaha still owns Apple today.I think there are four reasons why this might be the case.Buffett's investment strategy has long focused on finding outstanding businesses and aiming to hold them for a long time. In fact, his favorite holding period is forever.Apple has the makings of a forever stock. Its incredibly powerful brand supports its economic moat. And because customers are also using the company's software and services more, Apple has an ecosystem that drives stickiness. These traits have helped support the business's financial success.The added benefit of having an indefinite holding period is that it doesn't trigger a taxable event. This means compounding isn't interrupted unnecessarily.When picking stocks to invest in, the hope is that they can beat the market over the long term. Despite its huge market cap and premium valuation, Buffett might still believe that Apple has the potential to produce strong returns going forward.With dividends reinvested, the S&P 500 has historically returned an average of about 10% per year. This is a difficult hurdle for most active managers to beat. But Buffett may think there is a high chance that Apple can outperform the broader index.If this is the case, then there's absolutely no reason why he should sell, especially since he probably has expert knowledge about the business after owning it for all these years.Berkshire owns a 5.9% stake in Apple thanks to its holding of nearly 916 million shares. This massive position provides a financial windfall.Apple pays a dividend that yields a measly 0.52%. But based on the current quarterly payout of $0.24, Buffett's firm receives an annualized $879 million from its equity position in the tech giant.Apple uses the vast majority of its free cash flow to retire its outstanding stock. From the end of fiscal 2018 through the end of 2023, the business saw its share count shrink by 21%, a capital-allocation policy that increases Berkshire's ownership stake.In this instance, it's very easy to come up with reasons for why Apple should be sold right now. But let's also consider the opportunity cost. If Buffett sold the entire position today, what would Berkshire do with the almost $170 billion in proceeds?This sizable cash infusion would only exacerbate the conglomerate's problem. It already has $152 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury bills on the balance sheet, a sum that Buffett hasn't seemed to have had much use for in terms of finding compelling investments. He would likely have no idea what to do with more money that would come from selling Apple.This tells me that even though a valid argument can be made that at its current size and expensive valuation it should be sold, Apple still provides a better potential return than just holding cash. This might be what Buffett is thinking.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

       "  'Bill Gates, currently the eighth richest man in the world with a net worth of over $121 billion, made his fortune from Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). Since stepping down as CEO of Microsoft, Gates has invested across several assets to multiply his wealth.Gates\\'s investment portfolio currently holds 75 stocks and is valued at $38.91 billion as of Nov. 14. Several renowned billionaires have also invested in the stocks Gates holds, reflecting the resilience of respective large-cap companies amid the volatile market backdrop.While each billionaire investor has a unique approach, the majority of them have a substantial stake in the biggest tech stocks in the market. These technology giants who have dominated the market have withstood the test of time. As the macroeconomic headwinds, including economic slowdown concerns and uncertainty regarding the rate cut timeline persist, following billionaires\\' cues might be beneficial.Take a close look at a handful of blue chip stocks that not only appeal to Gates but also capture the attention of fellow billionaires.Gates owns 1.38% of the total outstanding shares of Microsoft. The Magnificent Seven stock dominated the tech space last year, with its strategic investments in OpenAI and the acquisition of Activision Blizzard attracting investors. Shares of Microsoft have risen by over 6% year to date, outperforming the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index\\'s 2% gains so far this year.The company\\'s growth potential has attracted several other billionaires as well. Billionaire portfolio manager Ken Fisher bought over 560,000 shares of Microsoft in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, bringing his total holdings to approximately 24.9 million shares. Microsoft is the second-largest holding in Fisher\\'s portfolio. Fisher\\'s Fisher Asset Management has over $236 billion in assets under management.Steven Cohen, founder and CEO of hedge fund company Point72 Asset Management, also bought over 203,000 shares of Microsoft in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Cohen owns 2.03 million shares of Microsoft, accounting for 2.18% of his total portfolio.Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin also bought nearly 1.63 million shares of Microsoft in the third quarter, increasing his stake in the tech behemoth by 47.9%.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it\\'s no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.Gates bought approximately 52,815 shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the third quarter. The Microsoft co-founder joined the Apple bandwagon relatively late, as many billionaires already have significant exposure to the tech giant. Warren Buffett, one of the most influential investors of this generation, considers Apple to be one of his crown jewels, claiming the business is \"better than anything we own.\"Buffett has a 5.9% stake in Apple as he owns over 915 million shares, making it his largest portfolio holding. He last bought Apple shares in the first quarter of 2023.Fisher increased his stake in Apple in the third quarter, scooping up over 878,000 shares. Apple is the largest holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 5.25% of its total portfolio.Concerns regarding slowing demand for Apple\\'s products have caused the stock to plummet this year. Given concerns regarding Apple\\'s sales in China amid tensions between the U.S. and China, the tech giant has been strategically shifting its production base to India. The company aims to produce nearly 25% of its iPhones in the Southeast Asian country.Bank of America upgraded Apple stock to Buy on Jan. 18, issuing a price target of $225. This indicates a potential upside of over 17%.Elon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles. Here’s how to join him in his latest venture with as little as $100.Collecting passive income from real estate just got a lot simpler.

       "  'The Fed crushed expectations of lowering interest rates by holding the current rates steady. However, there are several signs of the economy improving and this could mean lower rates in the coming months. But if you want to build a resilient portfolio that survives the ups and downs of the economy, you need to consider stocks that are worth holding on to for years — like reliable blue-chip stocks. While these stocks may not be cheap, they are stable companies with a long history, impressive balance sheet and a strong business. They understand the market, have a range of products and services and have proved themselves time and again. This is what sets it apart from the other companies, and such stocks are worth holding on to for years. Let’s take a look at the seven most reliable blue-chip stocks to buy and hold throughout 2024.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft\\xa0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest tech giants right now and its financials didn’t disappoint. In the\\xa0recent quarterly results, the company saw an 18% year-over-year (YOY) rise in revenue to hit $62 billion and it saw strong growth from the cloud services business.Driven by the Activision Blizzard acquisition, the company saw a 61% YOY jump in gaming revenue this quarter. Azure, its cloud business also saw a revenue growth of 30% YOY. The company has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has integrated AI into its products and services.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt expects to start seeing returns from this year. The company is already at its best, and MSFT stock is trading at $407 today. However, it will continue moving upward this year and is one stock that will keep rewarding you. It also enjoys a dividend yield of 0.74% making it a top choice for passive investors.Source: Claudio Divizia / Shutterstock.comI have been writing about Amazon\\xa0(NASDAQ:AMZN) for a while and had recommended a buy before the quarterly results. The e-commerce giant is set to have an excellent 2024, and its recent numbers are proof. A dynamite stock for the year, it has grown the cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) at a solid pace in the past five years.It saw a surge in revenue during the pandemic, significant lows due to high inflation and has rebounded in 2023. Amazon is firing on all cylinders, and it reported a 14% jump in revenue to hit\\xa0$170 billion\\xa0,and the EPS came in at $1. Even the sales at AWS saw a 13% jump to $24.2 billion, and this segment will continue growing throughout 2024.The advertising revenue has been on an upward momentum since the past quarter, and it saw a 27% YOY rise in sales to a record $14.7 billion. Trading at $170 today, the stock is up 51% in the year and shows no signs of slowing.Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comA personal favorite and a global business, Apple\\xa0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is winning the market with loyal customers. If you have used an Apple product once, there is very little chance that you would want to switch to a different company. Apple is a solid brand and has an enviable balance sheet.The company finally saw a surge in iPhone sales in the recent quarter and reported a revenue of\\xa0$119.6 billion\\xa0with an EPS of $2.18. The iPhone sales came in at $69.7 billion but the sales have slowed down in China. Even the sales of iPads have seen a drop. However, this is temporary.Apple is so much more than its devices and generates significant revenue from the Services segment. It reported a record revenue of $23.1 billion in services, and I believe this segment will continue to expand. The company is known for innovation and offering world-class products. Trading at $186 today, the stock is up 23% in the year, and this upward momentum will continue in 2024.Source: salarko / Shutterstock.comAlphabet’s\\xa0(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)\\xa0stock is down 6% over the past week, and any drop in the stock is a chance to buy. The drop is due to the recently announced results where the company produced a revenue of $65.5 billion from advertising, lower than analysts’ expectations. Its total revenue came in at $86.3 billion, and the operating income stood at $23.7 billion.Most of the revenue was from the advertising business, and the rest was from the search engine and the other social media products. However, the bigger picture for the company looks highly attractive, and there are many reasons to load up on the stock.The operating income and profit are growing at a healthy rate, and the stock hit a record high last month. It has dropped since then and is trading for $142 today. The company has missed expectations but only by a small number and this is not a reason to avoid the stock. GOOG stock is a strong buy and hold.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comStreaming giant Netflix\\xa0(NASDAQ:NFLX) is another option in reliable blue-chip stocks. The company has had a tough ride but it has survived through it all. In 2022, it saw a drop in revenue and membership growth, but the same picked pace in 2023, and it is entering this year on a very optimistic note. It stopped password sharing and cracked down on those who accessed the service without paying, and this has helped improve the revenue numbers.Its\\xa0fourth-quarter results\\xa0were also impressive. The company saw a 12.5% YOY rise in revenue growth, and the EPS came in at $2.11. Most importantly, the company added 13.1 million subscribers, its highest jump since 2020. Its growing member numbers and revenue growth are proof that this streaming giant is here to stay.It expects an even faster growth this year while aiming for an operating margin expansion. The stock is exchanging hands for $567 and isn’t cheap, but it is worth it. The stock is up 21% year-to-date (YTD) due to the quarterly results.Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comOne of the top fintech stocks, Visa\\xa0(NYSE:V) is a solid buy in 2024. The company has been thriving despite the unpleasant macroeconomic situations. It has a strong business model where it generates revenue whenever someone uses a Visa card.The company has a global presence and caters to more than 100 million merchants. In the recent quarterly reports, Visa reported a 9% YOY increase in revenue to\\xa0$8.6 billion, while the payments volume grew by 8% and the EPS was up 20%.Visa has never disappointed in the earnings, and it is a rock-solid business that will continue to grow as we transition from cash to card. It also boasts of a dividend yield of 0.75% and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.52. Visa is also making\\xa0strategic acquisitions\\xa0to enhance its position in the industry. Trading at $277, the stock is up 7% YTD.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockMcDonald’s\\xa0(NYSE:MCD) delicious burgers are raking in big revenue for the company. An excellent buy, the company has nailed the franchise business model and has managed to keep the operating costs down while steadily generating revenue.\\xa0It is one of the most reliable blue-chip stocks to own.It has done well despite inflation and boasts of a strong dividend yield of 2.27%. The stock is trading close to the 52-week high at $294 today but has the potential to grow at least 25% this year. The company is set to report earnings soon and I am certain it will be a blowout quarter, driven by the holiday season. It has already beaten revenue estimates for the past three quarters with an 11% rise in sales in the previous quarter.A highly reliable business, McDonald’s is generating enough cash to keep rewarding the shareholders and is one of the best brands in the market.

       "  'Midway through another earnings season, the free-fall in C-suite mentions of the movement for environment, social, and governance (ESG) strategies is on pace to plumb new depths.There have been just nine direct mentions\\xa0among S&P 500 companies of the politically controversial term amid the sea of hundreds of earnings calls in recent weeks, according to data from financial data company FactSet through Friday afternoon.That is a far cry from the 156 mentions among S&P 500 companies during the fourth quarter of 2021, when usage of the term peaked according to the company.And citations this year are either very brief or reflect a more charged political landscape, according to a Yahoo Finance analysis.\"Clients are taking a more measured approach to how they integrate ESG,\" noted Andy Wiechmann, the chief financial officer of finance company MSCI (MSCI) on his company\\'s earnings call, in just one example.The term has come up in a handful of other places, including on recent calls for stock market index operator NASDAQ (NDAQ), drug wholesaler Cencora (COR), and elevator maker Otis Worldwide (OTIS). But nearly all household names have moved away from the term entirely.That doesn\\'t mean that a conversation around the issues underlying ESG has been absent. Through the use of different buzzwords — or simply a straight-ahead discussion of how companies factor climate change into business decisions — the topic appears to be alive and well.Recent earnings from some of the top companies on Wall Street are perhaps the best example of the divergent trends.While no major bank brought up ESG directly, according to FactSet, climate and other issues remained a topic of much interest.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon made sure his investors were aware of \"an ongoing need for increased spending due to the green economy,\" adding that climate change was one of a few \"significant and somewhat unprecedented forces [that] cause us to remain cautious.\"Another example came on an earnings call for BlackRock (BLK), the world\\'s largest money manager.CEO Larry Fink has been among the faces of the ESG movement in recent years thanks to his annual letters urging companies and long-term investors to do more to prepare for climate change. But he recently grew disenchanted with the term and announced last June that he would stop saying it at all.He stayed true to that pledge on BlackRock\\'s Jan. 12 earnings call. The company unveiled plans to buy private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners but — without ever saying ESG — Fink made clear that a changing climate and \"the energy transition\" were key factors driving the $12.5 billion deal.\"If we are going to decarbonize the world ... capital and infrastructure is going to be very necessary,\" Fink told investors, adding \"that supply/demand imbalance creates compelling investment opportunities for our clients.\"The same trend held in the past week as Big Tech companies took center stage. There was little mention of ESG, but plenty of discussion of things like the climate.\"In recent months, we\\'ve also taken significant strides in our environmental work,\" Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook noted on his call.In addition, terms like \"sustainable investing,\" \"responsible business,\" and \"transition investing\" have also been floated by business leaders and corporate advisers in recent months as other ways to talk about the issues raised by ESG without using the term itself.A recent Global Strategy Group poll found overwhelming bipartisan support when Americans are asked whether they support companies \"that try to have a positive impact on their communities.\" That support falls dramatically among Republicans once the term ESG is introduced.Anti-ESG advocates are quick to claim that the declining prominence of the term is a win for their side as they work to stop what they call \"woke capitalism,\" which they say prioritizes a political agenda over maximizing returns for investors.The push against ESG has also scored some high-profile victories in recent years, such as when money management giant Vanguard withdrew from a climate-focused consortium called the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. Some ESG funds are also closing as investor interest moves elsewhere.But ESG advocates say there could be a silver lining for their side if the controversial term is largely taken off the table.\"Obviously the word ESG has been polarized,\" said Randell Leach, the CEO of a community bank called Beneficial State Bank largely devoted to social responsibility, in a recent interview.But he\\'s OK with that, saying he sees the change as a way to stop companies from pushing ESG as a cover for \"greenwashing\" and instead forcing a more direct case for the underlying principles.\"The market has evolved,\" he added.Dimon\\'s recent comments, Leach says, show the most powerful banker in the world can more directly make an affirmative case that taking climate into account \"is just smart business.\"Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance'],\n",

A well-managed sovereign wealth fund plays a vital role in a country's economy and adds to its surplus accounts. Popular sovereign wealth funds have investments in real and financial assets such as real estate, stocks, bonds, precious metals, and various other industries.\\xa0Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy has suffered a massive shock as it continues its way back to recovery. Following the pandemic, things got difficult for State-Owned Investors (SOIs). 2022 was one of the most difficult years for SOIs, especially impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine which led to an increase in oil prices and drove inflation rates to new levels in almost four decades. Today, the global economy faces more threats due to geopolitical turmoil including rising tensions in the Middle East. Iran and its proxies are up against Israel and its allies, amidst the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war situation. On February 2, BBC reported that the US has approved plans for strikes on Iranian targets in Iraq and Syria.\\xa0According to Global SWF, the sovereign wealth funds shrank for the first year in 2022. However, the scale of the drop in sovereign wealth funds’ wealth in 2022 is debatable as most SWFs report with significant delays. Still, the SWFs lost around $1 trillion in 2022, as per Global SWF.\\xa0Compared to 2022, 2023 was much better for sovereign wealth funds as they increased their spending. On January 1, Reuters reported Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) accumulated approximately a quarter of the $124 billion spent by SWFs worldwide in 2023. Saudi Arabia's SWF is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. Saudi Arabia generates most of its wealth from the oil economy and has designated a share of its oil wealth to the Public Investment Fund (PIF). The PIF spent a whopping $31.5 billion in 2023 compared to $123.8 billion spent for all sovereign wealth funds. Saudi Arabia is one of the richest Arab countries and the government is working on the diversification of its economy through various investments. PIF is playing a vital role in diversifying the country's economy. The PIF owns four of the biggest football clubs from the Saudi Pro League including Al-Ittihad, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr, and Al-Hilal. Football clubs from the Saudi Pro League have been able to attract global football stars and icons including Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, and World Cup winner N’Golo Kante.\\xa0In 2023, one of the major growth drivers for sovereign wealth funds worldwide was a strong rally in global stocks, which helped the SWFs gain a record $11.2 trillion. According to research by the Thinking Ahead Institute, the SWFs account for a record share of 38.9% of total assets among the largest 100 global asset owners.\\xa0Norway’s giant sovereign wealth fund has made massive gains in 2023. On January 30, Norges Bank Investment Management reported that Norway Government Pension Fund Global recorded a profit of 2.22 trillion Norwegian kroner, or $213 billion, in 2023. The remarkable gains for Norway Government Pension Fund Global were mainly driven by strong returns on its investments in technology stocks. The CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, Nicolai Tangen, said:“Despite high inflation and geopolitical turmoil, the equity market in 2023 was very strong, compared to a weak year in 2022. Technology stocks in particular performed very well.”By the end of 2023, Norway’s SWF had almost 71% investments in equities, 27.1% in fixed income, and 1.9% in unlisted real estate, among others. Norway Government Pension Fund Global has a small stake in about 9,000 companies worldwide including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY), and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KRX:005930), among others. The success of these tech companies is a major reason why Norway Government Pension Fund Global gained massive profits in 2023.\\xa0Over the past 12 months, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has given returns of almost 24%, while Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has returned 56%, as of February 2. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has made new advancements in its product line, including the latest launch of its mixed-reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, on February 2. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also one of Wall Street analysts' favorite stocks and has received 19 buy ratings from analysts over the past 3 months.On the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to advance in AI. On January 15, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that it has made a 10-year strategic collaboration with Vodafone Group Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:VOD). Through this partnership, the companies will collaborate to enhance Vodafone’s customer experience using Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) generative AI technology. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KRX:005930) also continues to advance its technology using AI on its Android phones and other electronic devices. On January 31, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KRX:005930) reported full-year 2023 results. The South Korean company posted KRW 258.94 trillion in annual revenue and KRW 6.57 trillion in operating profit.

       "  'The metaverse has taken a back seat in terms of media attention and investor sentiment about the future of the technology. However, companies continue to pour billions of dollars into the hardware and software that will allow people to connect in a virtual space. That suggests there might still be some investment opportunity to be had here.If you\\'re interested in the companies leading the way on the metaverse, three big tech companies should be front and center in your research. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Unity Software (NYSE: U) are the standout leaders in the metaverse today.Whether it intends it or not, Apple is a leader in the metaverse. The company creates and sells some of the devices consumers will use to interact virtually, whether that\\'s smartphones and computers or next-generation virtual reality headsets like the Vision Pro.Apple will also play a role in the creation and capture of virtual spaces. Most Apple iOS devices now include LiDAR, which helps map rooms or give spatial information about how far distances are in a virtual space. Apple\\'s Augmented Reality Kit (ARKit) is also a leading platform for digital assets, and it\\'s built into hundreds of millions of devices.The metaverse is going to need hardware to interact with the virtual space, and Apple will be at the center of that hardware race. Apple may not build the metaverse, but it will build the devices we use to get there.Meta Platforms changed its name from Facebook to tell investors this is now a metaverse company. Mark Zuckerberg is spending over $10 billion per year building the hardware and software to make his vision a reality. So far, it hasn\\'t led to financial success or widespread adoption, but that hasn\\'t stopped Meta Platforms.The Meta Quest 3 is Meta Platforms\\' latest virtual reality headset built to interact with metaverse assets the company is creating. It\\'s hard to call this device (or VR in general) a success for Meta, but it may lead to the technology that ultimately becomes successful.Meta\\'s Ray-Ban sunglasses are an example of where this technology could be used in more devices. They are capture devices today, but will likely add AR features in the future, bridging the digital world and physical world in ways that may be more natural than with Quest or Apple\\'s Vision Pro. \\xa0Meta is also beginning to incorporate artificial intelligence, which could be revolutionary in the metaverse. Users could ask the AI to make a virtual call to someone, create 3D assets, or pull up a sporting event or TV show in the virtual world.Meta Platforms may not be the dominant VR company a decade from now, but it\\'s hard to argue this won\\'t be a connective tissue in the metaverse, and that\\'s not a bad place to be.There are two game engines vying to be the metaverse leaders, Unity and Unreal. Unreal, made by Epic Games, has become the better high-fidelity game engine, but Unity\\'s claim to fame is as the preferred tool for making iOS games and VR content, and it is a preferred partner of Vision Pro at launch.Unity has struggled to find its footing as a public company as its business model has changed and advertising revenue hasn\\'t taken off as hoped. These are challenges management needs to overcome, but Unity\\'s value to metaverse developers is not in question.This is still the leading game engine for virtual worlds, and I think it\\'s more likely Unity\\'s quality improves than developers switch to Unreal wholesale.What we don\\'t know is what the metaverse will look like a decade from now. Will it be a \"place\" we go to meet friends and do business, or will it be more like a 3D conference call?No matter where we go in the metaverse, Apple, Meta, and Unity will be major players. For investors, that provides a lot of upside and optionality.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn\\'t one of them.

       "  'It wasn\\'t long ago that investors were wondering if a publicly traded U.S.-based company would ever reach the $1 trillion threshold. But in early August 2018, Apple hit that coveted mark. Not long after that, the market saw a correction. The market sold off heavily in late 2018 over tensions with the U.S.-China trade war and uncertain Federal Reserve policy. It eventually recovered, but then the COVID-19 sell-off of spring 2020 hit.Another recovery took hold in short order and Apple regained trillion-dollar status, even rising above $2 trillion. By early January 2022, Apple was knocking on the door of a $3 trillion market cap, Microsoft was hovering around $2.5 trillion, Alphabet was almost at $2 trillion, Amazon and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) were both over $1 trillion, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) was less than 10% away from hitting $1 trillion.2022 turned out to be a brutal year for big tech. When the dust had settled, only Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet were still above $1 trillion in market cap.Cycles happen, especially with companies with many different business units and an international footprint. Instead of trying to time the market by guessing which companies could surpass the $1 trillion threshold, a better idea would be to find the companies that can not only reach $1 trillion by the end of 2024 but are likely to build upon that valuation in the future.After Meta\\'s blowout earnings report this week, six companies are currently over $1 trillion in market cap -- Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Meta.Here\\'s why Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) are two top stocks worth buying before returning to trillion-dollar valuations.Tesla stock doubled in 2023 but it is still down nearly 50% from its all-time high. And for good reason. Despite hitting its 2023 production goal, Tesla\\'s growth has slowed -- especially when you look at profits and revenue. Its margins are also down as Tesla had to cut prices to make up for weak demand.If you look at trailing-12-month figures, sales are up just 11.5%, net income is down 8.5%, and the operating margin has fallen by over 25% to just 11.2%.CEO Elon Musk hasn\\'t done the company any favors as of late either, saying he is \"uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics\" unless he has more voting control of the company.Tesla can be a roller coaster of a stock and will probably remain volatile not just because it is in a cyclical industry, but also because the top brass can pour a lot of emotion into the company. However, you can argue that this emotion has done more good than harm.Tesla remains the undisputed leader in electric vehicles (EVs). And although competition is mounting, no company is close to holding a candle to Tesla when it comes to the balance between profitability, international exposure, growth potential, and the trajectory the company is on to release lower-priced EV models for customers.Six years ago, Tesla was inconsistently profitable and hadn\\'t scaled production of the Model 3 to achieve consistent cash flows. At that stage, emotional comments carried more weight. But today, Tesla is much more secure. Elon Musk is the voice of Tesla, but he is far from calling all the shots or operating with unilateral control.Tesla has the balance sheet and cash flows to endure a self-inflicted setback or an industrywide slowdown. There\\'s also a good chance that Tesla will take market share during a slowdown rather than lose it because other companies with legacy operations and budding EV segments may be more inclined to cut EV spending than damage an existing cash cow.Overall, Tesla is a good balance of risk and reward if you can stomach the volatility.Hovering around an all-time high and a market cap of just over $800 billion, Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway is the second-closest company to $1 trillion behind Meta. The company has a lot of ways it can get there. The value of its public equity portfolio alone is $368.8 billion -- leaving the rest of the business to be valued at about $438.3 billion.Berkshire owns dozens of companies outright and has stakes in several private businesses. The sheer size of the overall company can be difficult to wrap your head around. Berkshire could be undervalued based on the major contributors alone.Berkshire\\'s insurance businesses alone hold a treasure trove of value thanks to their predictable earnings and stability. The property and casualty insurance businesses are split into the investing side and the underwriting side. Its underwriting operations include GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group.Berkshire is a master underwriter and has built a sizable float that grew to approximately $164 billion at the end of 2022. Valuing the insurance business alone by its float, which would be ultra-conservative, would make this asset worth around 20% of the overall market cap of the company.There\\'s also Berkshire\\'s ownership of BNSF railroad, which booked nearly $6 billion in net earnings in 2022. Berkshire also owns a 92% stake in Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which could be worth around $90 billion. Finally, Berkshire generated $12.51 billion in net earnings from its manufacturing, service, and retailing businesses in 2022.Putting just a 10 price-to-earnings multiple on BNSF railroad and the manufacturing, service, and retailing business would make those businesses worth over $180 billion combined.Add it all up, and very conservative valuations make Berkshire worth what it is today. Reasonable valuations would easily push its worth up over $1 trillion. Berkshire can surpass and stay above $1 trillion for a variety of reasons, like growing its businesses over time or multiple expansions for what it already owns.Investing in a stock just because it is going up is a good way to lose money. To buy shares in a business, you need to be able to justify that it will be worth more in the future than it is today. Tesla is an industry leader with clear growth paths. Berkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate that blends value and growth from various sectors.Both stocks have done well over the last year and could pull back if the market sells off. But if the market keeps rallying, I could see both companies worth over $1 trillion by the end of the year. In three to five years, it would be very surprising if any of these companies were worth less than $1 trillion.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

       "  'Thanks to its lineup of incredibly popular hardware products, and its budding services and software offerings, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become one of the most valuable businesses on the face of the planet. Its expertise and dominant success in the consumer-focused tech world could be beneficial when it comes to potential acquisitions.Consider Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON). This once-thriving exercise equipment and app enterprise has experienced falling demand and ongoing net losses. Maybe its turnaround plans could get a boost with some help.With its massive financial resources, is there a possibility the iPhone maker will go out and buy the struggling fitness company? Here are two important things that investors should know about the ongoing rumors of this deal.Apple specializes in developing beautiful hardware differentiated by its own proprietary software, which is exactly what Peloton does. The difference is that Apple has maintained lasting success in a profitable manner, thanks to an emphasis on its innovative culture, brand strength, and pricing power. Peloton wants to be just like this.With the Watch and Fitness+, Apple already has a presence in the health space. CEO Tim Cook said in 2019 that Apple\\'s greatest contribution to humanity \"will be about health.\" The overarching goal to improve people\\'s lives is something Peloton shares with Apple.This deal might make sense strategically. Apple already has over 2 billion active devices. Adding exercise equipment into high-income households would provide another avenue to collect data, and there are neat ways the two companies could find ways to integrate.For example, Apple Music could provide all the music for Peloton\\'s massive workout catalog. And through Apple Card, Apple could provide certain rewards or incentives to buy a piece of Peloton\\'s hardware.Apple also has the financial resources to buy Peloton with cash. In fiscal 2023, the tech enterprise produced $100 billion of free cash flow. There is more than enough cash in its coffers.Now that we\\'ve looked at all the compelling reasons that demonstrate why Apple would be a no-brainer buyer for Peloton, let\\'s consider why I don\\'t see this deal happening anytime soon.For starters, Apple isn\\'t known for a corporate strategy that favors sizable acquisitions. Its largest purchase occurred in 2014 when it bought Beats for $3 billion. At a meaningful premium to Peloton\\'s current market cap of $2.1 billion, a possible takeover would still be in the ballpark as one of Apple\\'s biggest. I don\\'t know if management is trying to do this.Apple generated $383 billion of revenue in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30). In its fiscal 2023 (ended June 30), Peloton registered sales of $2.8 billion. Even if the exercise company saw its revenue surge under Apple, it still might simply be too small an opportunity.On the one hand, if this deal did happen, but ended up not working out, the purchase price would be a rounding error for Apple, and shareholders would likely shrug it off. At least executives would have tried something that made strategic sense, but just wasn\\'t in the cards.But let\\'s say this transaction became a reality, and Peloton was successfully integrated into Apple\\'s operations, with a return to growth and profitability for the fitness business. It still wouldn\\'t move the needle for the tech giant.Apple basically has the entire global population as its addressable market. Those who are interested in spending a four-figure sum to buy exercise equipment are a tiny fraction of this. Nonetheless, should this deal ever be on the table, it would undoubtedly benefit Peloton much more than Apple.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn\\'t one of them.

       "  'In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12\\xa0Stocks.\\xa0For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article\\xa0Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 5\\xa0Stocks.After recommending investors to go easy on mega-cap tech stocks and take some profits on them during the start of 2024, Jim Cramer is back to praising the strengths and resilience of these companies after major technology stocks part of the Magnificent Seven group started posting earnings. Cramer recently said in a program on CNBC that we have reached a strange \"confluence of events\" that makes it hard to \"value anything.\" Cramer praised strong earnings reports from Apple, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Cramer advised investors not to worry about high valuations of these companies and said it does not make sense to sell these stocks just because these companies are \"big.\" Cramer said these major technology companies have not \"fooled\" their way to such high valuations and there was nowhere else to go for these stocks \"but up.\"Jim Cramer\\'s message to market skeptics who believe tech stocks are headed for a crash is this: \"enough already!\"Cramer said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) generated about $330 billion in collective revenue and about $58.5 billion in collective profits in the recently reported quarter. Cramer said it would not make sense to compare these companies with those that collapsed during the dot com bubbleOn a side note, Cramer shrugged off China fears and recommended investors to \"own\" Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares and not trade it.Cramer yet again criticized the market\\'s fears around concentration of the broader stock market gains in a handful of companies also known as the Magnificent Seven group of stocks. Cramer said it does not make sense to worry about market gains of major companies and compare them to smaller companies. Cramer, however, was clear about Tesla as he believes the company no longer deserves to be in the Magnificent Seven group. Cramer said Tesla\\'s exit from the Mag. Seven group of stocks was made easier by the judge who recently rejected Elon Musk\\'s $56 billion pay package.Despite this bullish outlook on tech stocks, there are some companies Jim Cramer is bearish on. In this article we decided to talk about those stocks.For this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 12 stocks he\\'s bearish on. For each stock we talked about the reason Jim Cramer gave for his bearish stance. We ranked these stocks based on ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors. Why? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 7Jim Cramer, when asked about Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR) in a recent program, said he does not know \"what mortgages they have\" and therefore cannot recommend the stock.\"And I suggest you do not own it.\"Over the past one year Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR) shares have declined by 41%.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, seven hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR). The most notable hedge fund stakeholder of Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR) during this period was Sander Gerber\\'s Hudson Bay Capital Management which owns a $4.3 million stake in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 17Jim said \"I don’t trust it\" when he was asked about Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) during his program on CNBC. Cramer said he just \"checked in\" with Larry Williams \"again\" and Williams said Bitcoin has not bottomed yet and you should \"stay away.\"Last month, Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) said it produced 619 bitcoins in December 2023, down 9% on a year-over-year basis.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 17 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 18A few days ago a caller told Jim Cramer during a program on CNBC that \"AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) has got me in a hole.\" Cramer commented:\"You are not doing well at all.\"Cramer said that we \"don’t want AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC)\" because the company is not \"doing well.\" Cramer said we want to own stocks that \"go higher.\"\"Let\\'s understand that consumers are not going to the movies like they used to.\"Cramer also pitched Netflix as a stock to buy instead of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 20Jim Cramer\\'s reply was a resounding \"No\" when he was asked about US Silica Holdings Inc (NYSE:SLCA) during his program a few days ago.Cramer said that you can\\'t own this stock in this state (New Jersey).The stock has declined by about 12% over the past one year.As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 20 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in US Silica Holdings Inc (NYSE:SLCA). The most notable stakeholder of US Silica Holdings Inc (NYSE:SLCA) during this period was DE Shaw which owns a $9 million stake in US Silica Holdings Inc (NYSE:SLCA).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 25Education technology company Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG) ranks eighth in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on.“I think it’s an exploratory situation, but I cannot press the buy button,\" Cramer said of Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG).As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 25 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG).Cramer is bearish on Chegg but he\\'s recommending investors to buy and hold Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 26Jim Cramer is highly bearish on Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG). In a latest program, while talking about a few renewable energy stocks, Cramer said:\"Plug Power? ….Grenade! Fire in the hole!\"In December 2023 Cramer had categorically said that he was pulling the plug on Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG).As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 26 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 27SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) ranks sixth in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on. Cramer said \"no\" when he was asked about the Israel-based solar technology company.Cramer said the stock is too volatile as it \"bounces four points and then it goes down again.\"Cramer said this stock is too hard to own.Out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 27 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG).Unlike Solaredge, Jim Cramer is bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).During its Q3 earnings call in November 2023, Solaredge management talked about guidance and business updates:\"We expect our annual non-GAAP tax rate for the entire 2023 to be within 22% to 24%. GAAP net loss for the third quarter was $61.2 million compared to a GAAP net income of $119.5 million in the previous quarter and GAAP net income of $24.7 million in the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net loss was $31 million compared to a non-GAAP net income of $157.4 million in the previous quarter, and a non-GAAP net income of $54.1 million in the same quarter last year. GAAP net diluted loss per share was $1.08 for the third quarter compared to a GAAP net diluted earnings per share of $2.03 in the previous quarter, and a GAAP net diluted earnings per share of $0.43 for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted loss per share was $0.55 compared to a non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share of $2.62 in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share of $0.91 in the same quarter last year.As mentioned by Zvi, we expect that the stabilized solar revenue levels after the inventory correction has run its course will be approximately $600 million to $700 million quarterly. Under this scenario, corporate non-GAAP gross margins are targeted to be 30% to 32%, including approximately 500 basis points of benefits from IRA manufacturing tax credit and operating profit margins are targeted to be at 11% to 14% after implementing cost reduction activities. I reiterate that this scenario is based on no improvement in demand from our third quarter sell through levels and assumes no incremental revenues or margin from new products. Turning now to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $1.5 billion.\"Read the entire earnings call transcript here.ClearBridge Select Strategy made the following comment about SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Solar energy technology companies\\xa0SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.\\xa0(NASDAQ:SEDG) and Shoals, meanwhile, saw headwinds from destocking in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. demand could slow further due to new net metering rules that reduce the value to consumers from sending excess residential solar energy back to the grid.

       "  'Big Tech isn\\'t just big anymore. It\\'s massive.The market\\'s six biggest tech companies, all of which have reported December quarter earnings over the past two weeks, are now valued at just over $11.3 trillion.Throw in Nvidia\\xa0 (NVDA) , which hit a record high on Friday, and the tally rises to just a shade under $13 trillion.That\\'s around 31.3% of the entire $41.128 trillion that investors are collectively valuing the S&P 500, the broadest measure of U.S. blue chip companies.Nvidia reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 21.That makes the seven largest tech stocks worth around half of the collective value of the remaining 493 stocks on what is effectively the world\\'s equity benchmark.It\\'s a common error to compare market values, which represent a measure of wealth, to the GDP of a country, which represents the flow of economic gains, so that parallel that won\\'t be made here.But it\\'s not beyond the realm of economics to compare the collective revenue generated by the Super Six tech giants, which topped $500 billion last quarter, to a country\\'s GDP.That tally would compare closely to Thailand, which had a nominal GDP value of around $495 billion last year. Add in Nvidia and you\\'re getting closer to Israel, at $522 billion.Getty Images/ TheStreetExtrapolate the fourth quarter gains to an annual run-rate, and you\\'re looking at something closer to Canada, which was last pegged at $2.14 trillion.The Super Six, the group that\\'s reported fourth-quarter earnings so far, are also wringing an impressive amount of profit from those eye-watering revenues.Microsoft\\xa0 (MSFT) , Alphabet\\xa0GOOGL, Amazon\\xa0 (AMZN) , Meta Platforms\\xa0 (META) , Apple\\xa0 (AAPL) , and Tesla\\xa0 (TSLA) \\xa0generated around $110 billion in net income over the December quarter, topped by the iPhone maker\\'s $34 billion.AI might actually make those number even bigger.\"AI is going to make all of the products and services that we use and make better,\" Meta Platforms\\xa0founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors after the group\\'s blowout fourth quarter earnings, which triggered the biggest single-day gain in stock market history.Related: Analysts reveal new Microsoft price targets after AI costs cloud earnings\"A major goal will be building the most popular and most advanced AI products and services,\" he added. \"And if we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open source model to build with.\"That\\'s a lot of \"every ones,\" for sure, but it certainly illustrates the level of conviction that company bosses have for a technology that, only two years ago, could barely be described in functional terms.“Investors are excited by the promises and possibilities of artificial intelligence services,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of London\\'s deVere Group. \"Companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia have been leading the charge in AI innovation (and\\xa0are) looking for clues on the companies that will benefit the most from the possibilities.\"Those companies, in turn are spending billions – hundreds of billions, in fact – to ensure they deliver.Meta sees expenses rising to between $94 billion and $99 billion this year, while Amazon said its 2024 capex would rise from last year\\'s $48.4 billion tally \"primarily driven by increased infrastructure capex, support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments in generative AI and large language models.\"Google parent Alphabet\\xa0GOOGL, meanwhile, which saw capital spending surge 45% from a year ago over the fourth quarter to $11 billion, said that figure would rise \"notably\" in the coming year.Related: Analysts unveil new Google stock price targets after earningsCFO Ruth Porat said the \"sharp step-up\" was a reflection of \"our outlook for the extraordinary applications of AI to deliver for users, advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers, and governments globally and the long-term growth opportunities that offers.\"You get the picture.Even Apple\\xa0 (AAPL) , which has heretofore been happy to build in incremental (and, it must be said, not terribly exciting) improvements in the iPhone that translate into faster growth rates for its services division, has caught the AI bug.Apple CEO Tim Cook\\xa0told investors that generative AI technologies remain a \"huge opportunity\" for Apple and talked about \"a lot of work going on internally\" in the earnings conference call late Thursday.\"Our \\'MO\\', if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so, we\\'re going to hold that to this as well,\" Cook said. \"But we\\'ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we\\'ll be talking about later this year.\"Microsoft\\xa0 (MSFT) \\xa0CEO Satya Nadella put it best: \"We\\'re moving from\\xa0talking about AI to applying AI at scale,\" he told investors last week as they balked at the group\\'s spending pace, which rose 4% to $16 billion last quarter with \"material\" increases to come.Microsoft itself justified some of its early AI spending by noting that AI infusions added around 6 percentage points to the revenue growth of Azure, its flagship cloud product, over the three months ended in December.Related: Analysts unveil new Apple price targets after earningsThat\\'s more than double the impact over the September quarter and helped Azure grow revenue by around 30%, which in turn powered a better-than-expected top line for the group\\'s Intelligent Cloud unit of $25.9 billion.\"We believe this is the start of a multi-year initiative aimed at generating significant AI use cases for customers across the enterprise landscape to gain further efficiencies while accelerating profitable growth with Redmond leading the charge in this potential $1 trillion opportunity,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.At the rate the Magnificent 7 are growing, a trillion dollars might not buy you a seat at the table.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024'],\n",

       "  \"After the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) fell by over 19% in 2022, the stock market's most popular index has been on an impressive run since the beginning of 2023. It finished 2023 up by over 24%, and the momentum in 2024 has it at an all-time high.The S&P 500's performance has been great news, but it can also cause some investors to question if now's the right time to enter the market or add to their holdings. Despite the index being at an all-time high, here are two stocks I'll be adding to my retirement account regardless. Each company has long-term growth potential and stability that I don't have to second-guess.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is now the only company in the coveted $3 trillion market cap club, after Apple dropped below the mark (as of Jan. 29).Arguably, no other tech company has done as impressive a job as Microsoft when it comes to building a well-diversified ecosystem of products and services. Unlike Apple (which relies heavily on the iPhone), Alphabet (which relies heavily on Google advertising), or Amazon (which relies heavily on e-commerce), Microsoft's businesses span a broad range, with each holding its own weight.Microsoft's diversified business model has worked wonders for its financials. In the past five years, its revenue and net income have jumped, but the pace at which its net income has grown shows the efficiency of its operations.What I appreciate more than just the impressive financials -- and why I trust the company for the long haul -- is where this money comes from: other corporations. Microsoft has done a great job intertwining itself in the global business work, to the point where many businesses wouldn't function as efficiently without Microsoft's products and services.Consider how many corporations rely on Microsoft Office for Excel, Azure for cloud services, LinkedIn for recruiting, and Windows for their operating system. The list goes on, and this likely won't change anytime soon. As Microsoft continues to innovate and attract corporate customers, I trust its position as a key part of the global business world will remain strong.A vital characteristic I want in a company that I'm adding to my retirement portfolio is an economic moat. In Visa's (NYSE: V) case, its economic moat is its global reach. With over 130 million merchant locations and 4.3 billion cards in circulation, Visa is the payment processing industry leader -- and it's not even close.\\xa0In the payment processing industry, Visa's reach is important because the network effect allows it to grow organically. If you're a potential cardholder or merchant, you're more incentivized to go with Visa because it's the most accepted and used card. This network effect has helped the company expand globally at an impressive pace. In its 2023 fiscal year (ended Sept. 30), its cross-border volume grew 20% year over year, and its total processed transactions grew 10% year over year.\\xa0\\xa0Visa's market dominance isn't going anywhere (if ever), and the emergence of digital payments gives it lots of growth opportunities going forward. With industry-leading profit margins and free cash flow, Visa has the financial strength to continue expanding its global reach and innovating with the payment industry.When most people think of dividend stocks, their minds don't go to Microsoft and Visa. However, both companies do, in fact, pay a dividend. Dividends reward investors for their patience (regardless of stock price movements) as well as add to their total returns. Sometimes, a dividend is meant to make up for a lack of stock price growth. In Microsoft and Visa's case, the dividend is a two-for-one gift to investors. Both companies have high stock price growth opportunities, so the dividend is a bonus.By no means are their dividend yields eye-popping, but any little bit can add up over time -- especially with the companies increasing the payouts annually. Microsoft and Visa's trailing-12-month dividend yields are both only around 0.70%, but they've both increased nicely over the past decade.When you're investing for retirement, stocks that pay dividends are great, but stocks that increase their dividends annually are better. The compounding effect can really pay off over time. Buy Microsoft and Visa stock, and let time work its magic.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

       "  'By Stephen Nellis and Dawn Chmielewski(Reuters) - Apple\\'s Vision Pro could upend how people watch television at home and how they use computers at work, potentially positioning the headset to be a successor to both traditional television and the Mac.The $3,500 headset, which blends three-dimensional digital content with a view of the outside world, landed in the company’s physical U.S. stores on Friday. It enters a market crowded with lower-cost rivals from Meta Platforms, HTC and others that have mostly been confined to the video game market and failed to find a mass audience.But Apple\\'s pricey device comes with custom computing chips and difficult-to-manufacture displays that rivals lack. Analysts who have tried the headset say these features could make the device a threat to almost every large two-dimensional screen at home or work.Walt Disney has quietly worked with Apple for years on an app for the Vision Pro\\'s launch, the latest in a history of collaboration between the two companies.“When we saw this, it became evident it was a new canvas for how we can tell stories in a way that hasn\\'t been done before,” said Aaron LaBerge, chief technology officer of Disney Entertainment. “And so it became pretty obvious that we wanted to do something here just as a way to stretch ourselves.”The Disney+ app envelops movie viewers in one of four environments, so they can watch “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” from the seat of a fictional X-34 landspeeder craft on the planet of Tatooine, like a futuristic drive-in movie theater, or catch “Avengers: Endgame” from inside Avengers Tower in midtown Manhattan. Viewers can also watch 42 Disney films in 3D, including box office hits “Avatar: The Way of Water,” “Black Panther” and “Inside Out.”Jamie Voris, chief technology officer at Walt Disney Studios, said filmmakers such as “The Lion King” director Jon Favreau and James Cameron of \"Avatar\" are interested in telling stories in new ways. Disney has built an experience it teased in a clip screened at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference last June, in which consumers interact with its Marvel Studios animated anthology series, “What If?”The device also opens new ways to experience live sporting events or theme park rides, Voris said.“It speaks really well to what we do best, which is bring our characters and stories into the real world and bring you closer to the people that you care about,” said Voris.It’s not clear that a mixed-reality device was what late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had in mind when he confided to biographer Walter Isaacson that, in developing a next-generation television, “I finally cracked it.” But to analysts like Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies, the Vision Pro seemed like it fulfilled that long-ago promise.\"I don\\'t know if this is what Jobs meant when he said \\'I cracked TV,\\'\" said Bajarin. \"But the platform element is what makes it more interesting than if they launched a TV. It can be productivity. It can be social. ... It could become a much bigger deal and a much bigger opportunity than if it were just a TV.\"To be sure, the pricey Vision Pro will not be a quick best-seller. In a note to investors, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple has told its supply chain to expect to build only 1 million units - and even that might be Apple preparing excess capacity ahead of consumer demand.Apple’s approach “suggests a lack of confidence that consumers will feel compelled to buy immediately without needing to be convinced by in-store demos,” Sacconaghi wrote.But the high price presents less of a barrier to business purchasers.Jay Wright, chief executive of Campfire, a startup that makes software for using headsets to collaborate remotely on three-dimensional files such as engine designs, noted that the original Mac computer in 1984 cost the equivalent of nearly $7,500 today. But small businesses flocked to the Mac for its ability to create and print documents and brochures.“It\\'s important to recognize this is not a consumer accessory device, like Apple Watch. This is a whole new computing platform,” Wright said. “I\\'m of the opinion that this is more like what comes after the Mac than what comes after the iPhone.”(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker)'],\n",

       "  'It wasn\\'t all that long ago that Apple seemed invincible. The iPhone maker was the first publicly traded company in the U.S. to surpass a $1 trillion market cap and has continued to check off succeeding benchmarks seemingly with ease: the first to sail past $2 trillion and $3 trillion, respectively.Over the past year or so, however, competition for the crown has stiffened, and Apple has traded places numerous times with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which currently holds the market cap crown, with a market cap of more than $3.01 trillion, ahead of Apple\\'s $2.87 trillion. One analyst believes that could be the new order of things, with two more stocks poised to hurtle past Apple\\'s valuation in the years to come.Late in 2022, a sudden leap forward in the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) caught many off guard. To be clear, these sophisticated algorithms have been around in one form or another for decades, but 2023 seemed to mark a turning point in interest for the technology.The advent of generative AI took the technology to the next level, with the ability to not only search data for patterns, but create entirely new content from scratch with only minor prompts from the user. Perhaps more importantly, these AI models can automate menial tasks and improve processes, thereby freeing up workers to be more productive.The resulting gold rush to adopt AI has caused a paradigm shift, particularly among those companies that are best positioned to provide AI to the masses.Microsoft was first off the blocks, with a $13 billion stake in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. The company quickly developed AI tools for its own software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings, including Microsoft Office and 365.The headliner is Copilot, the company\\'s AI-fueled digital assistant, which offers more than 150 new features designed to save time and increase productivity. These features include summarizing email messages and drafting potential responses, creating presentations from existing data, and writing and debugging computer code, among many other functions.Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) was also quick off the mark. Its Pathways Language Model (PaLM) gave way to Gemini, which the company describes as \"Google\\'s most capable AI model yet.\" The company said that its high-end Gemini Ultra model outperformed ChatGPT and \"exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development.\"Not to be outdone, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) introduced Q, a business-focused AI assistant designed to help its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure users streamline many of the same mundane tasks as its rivals, including searching the internet and corporate databases, summarizing emails and documents, and completing internal support requests, among other mundane tasks. Amazon also made a $4 billion investment and announced a strategic collaboration with Open AI competitor Anthropic AI.Savvy investors will note the common thread here: Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are collectively referred to as the \"Big Three\" cloud computing providers.Late last year, Needham analyst Laura Martin reiterated her view that the trio of cloud infrastructure providers -- Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud -- have the most to gain from generative AI as the gatekeepers of the LLMs, suggesting they could capture a percentage of every new generative AI app created. \"Generative AI will redefine the basis of competition for media and internet companies,\" she wrote in a note to clients.Martin thinks AI is a natural fit for the cloud providers:Not only do [Microsoft, AWS, and Google Cloud\\'s] LLMs have the lowest cost structures and first-mover advantages, but their average lifetime value per cloud customer is about to skyrocket, owing to the stickiness of apps built on their LLMs.There\\'s evidence that seems to support her conclusion. By some estimates, 60% of all corporate data lives in the cloud, according to online data provider Statista. The practice is widespread, as an estimated 98% of corporations worldwide store at least some of their data in the cloud, according to cybersecurity solutions provider Check Point. Given the extensive reach of the trio, it\\'s reasonable to conclude they are in the best position to benefit from the ongoing adoption of AI.The news isn\\'t all bad for Apple shareholders. The company is reportedly working on AI of its own, including generative AI models. However, the technology is expected to focus on \"protecting their installed base\" of iPhones, according to Martin. This makes sense, given that 52% of Apple\\'s $383 billion in fiscal 2023 revenue came from sales of the iPhone.Estimates regarding the market opportunity for AI vary wildly, but even the most conservative estimates place the impact at $1 trillion over the coming decade -- and some estimates are much higher.The benefits of generative AI are twofold for Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Not only do they have the opportunity to improve their existing businesses with the help of AI, but they will also benefit by using their extensive cloud infrastructure reach to sell AI services to the masses.There\\'s also the matter of valuation to consider. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are currently selling for 33 times, 31 times, and 20 times forward earnings, as of this writing, making them relatively inexpensive in terms of the vast opportunity ahead. Don\\'t expect this sale to last long.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

       "  \"Apple Inc's robust financial performance with a significant increase in net income.Continued dominance in the smartphone market with the iPhone as a key revenue driver.Expansion in services and wearables presenting new growth avenues.Challenges from global economic uncertainties and competitive pressures.Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), a global leader in technology, released its 10-Q filing on February 2, 2024, revealing the company's financial performance for the quarter ended December 30, 2023. The filing indicates a solid financial position, with net sales amounting to $119.575 billion, a slight increase from the previous year's $117.154 billion. The company's net income saw a notable rise to $33.916 billion from $29.998 billion, showcasing Apple's ability to maintain profitability amidst a competitive landscape. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the recent SEC filing, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of Apple Inc's strategic positioning.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CHTR.Financial Resilience and Product Dominance: Apple's financial health remains robust, with an increase in net income to $33.916 billion, up from $29.998 billion in the previous year. This financial resilience is underpinned by the iPhone's continued dominance in the market, contributing significantly to the company's revenue. Apple's ability to maintain high-profit margins, particularly in its services segment, which saw an 11% increase in net sales, further solidifies its financial strength. The company's diversified product portfolio, including the Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, complements the iPhone ecosystem, creating a comprehensive suite of products that drive customer loyalty and recurring revenue.Innovation and Brand Equity: Apple's commitment to research and development, with expenses maintained at $7.696 billion, underscores its focus on innovation. The company's brand is synonymous with quality and innovation, which is reflected in its strong gross margin of $54.855 billion. Apple's brand equity is a competitive advantage that allows it to command premium pricing and maintain a loyal customer base. The introduction of new products, such as the updated MacBook Pro and iMac, demonstrates Apple's continuous effort to innovate and meet consumer demands.Dependence on Key Products: Despite its financial success, Apple's heavy reliance on the iPhone, which accounts for a significant portion of its revenue, poses a risk. Any disruption in the iPhone's market appeal or supply chain could have a substantial impact on the company's overall performance. Additionally, the decrease in iPad sales by 25% indicates potential vulnerabilities in Apple's product mix that need to be addressed to ensure sustained growth.Supply Chain and Geopolitical Risks: Apple's supply chain is complex and global, with significant exposure to geopolitical risks and trade tensions, particularly in Greater China, where net sales decreased by 13%. The company's reliance on outsourcing partners and individual suppliers for components and manufacturing also presents operational risks that could affect its ability to deliver products efficiently and cost-effectively.Services and Wearables Expansion: The growth in Apple's services and wearables segments presents significant opportunities. With an 11% increase in services net sales, Apple is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for digital content, cloud services, and subscription-based models. The wearables market also offers potential for expansion, despite a decrease in sales, as consumer interest in health and fitness technology continues to rise.International Markets and New Technologies: Apple's performance in international markets, such as a 15% increase in Japan net sales, highlights the opportunity for further geographic expansion. Additionally, the company's investments in new technologies, such as augmented reality and artificial intelligence, could open up new revenue streams and strengthen its competitive position in the long term.Competitive Pressure and Market Saturation: The technology industry is highly competitive, with rapid innovation and changing consumer preferences. Apple faces intense competition from other smartphone and technology manufacturers, which could erode its market share and pressure margins. Market saturation, particularly in mature markets, poses a challenge to growth, as most consumers already own smartphones and upgrade cycles lengthen.Economic Uncertainties and Regulatory Changes: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation and currency fluctuations, can impact consumer spending and Apple's international sales. Regulatory changes, such as those related to privacy and antitrust concerns, could also force Apple to alter its business practices, potentially affecting its profitability and strategic direction.In conclusion, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) exhibits a strong financial foundation and brand equity, driven by its flagship iPhone and a growing services segment. However, the company must navigate challenges such as product dependence, supply chain complexities, and competitive pressures. Opportunities for expansion in services, wearables, and international markets are countered by threats from market saturation and regulatory changes. Apple's strategic focus on innovation and customer experience positions it to leverage its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats in the dynamic tech landscape.This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

       "  \"This week in tech earnings showed some bright spots in video and music streaming at Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). All three companies saw subscription and advertising revenue grow significantly in the December quarter and credited the success to their respective video and music streaming platforms.On the Apple earnings call yesterday (Feb. 1), Apple’s services unit, which includes Apple TV+ and Apple Music, was a central\\xa0topic of discussion. Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, produced by Apple Studios, got a mention from CEO Tim Cook, who noted the movie’s 200-plus accolades, including 10 Oscar nominations this year, are growing Apple’s awards portfolio. “Across all Apple TV+ productions, we’ve now earned 2,050 award nominations and 450 wins since we’ve introduced the service,” Cook said.Apple’s services unit passed 1 billion paid subscribers at the end of 2023 and brought in $23.1 billion in quarterly revenue, an 11 percent jump from the previous year. Apple’s chief financial officer Luca Maestri expects another double-digit growth in the current quarter.\\xa0“Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business,” Maestri said on the earnings call. “And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services.”\\xa0Amazon’s advertising services revenue jumped 27 percent in the December quarter to $14.7 billion. Revenue from subscriptions to digital products like music, games and books rose 14 percent to $10.5 billion. Though user reaction to Amazon bringing ads on Prime Video (which made an ad-free subscription more expensive) has been mixed, the company seems optimistic that the ad-tier plans will bring in more users. “We are looking for ways to increase our advertising in our streaming properties, including Fire TV…and Prime Video, but also things like Freevee and Twitch,” Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said yesterday’s earnings call. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Over the last few years, Alphabet has been more open about disclosing financial details at YouTube. In its quarterly report on Jan. 30, Alphabet disclosed YouTube’s paid subscriber number for the first time. The video platform had more than 100 million subscribers (including non-paying trial subscribers) at the end of 2023. On the earnings call, Alphabet and Google (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai said YouTube is the main driver of the company’s subscription revenue.Lyor Cohen, the head of music at YouTube and Google, touted some of the steps Alphabet has taken to grow its subscription business, crediting early access to A.I. tools and generative A.I. music covers as some of the factors. “From leveraging A.I. to enhance creative imagination to seamlessly bridging short-form and long-form content for maximum artist exposure, we can forge a future together where the music industry thrives,” Cohen said in a blog post yesterday.\\xa0Elon Musk Launched His Red Tesla Roadster Into Space 6 Years Ago—Where Is It Now?'Poor Things': See It And Hate Yourself in the MorningFacebook Turns 20: Where Are Its Five Founders Now?The Complete List of All the Stuff You Can Anonymously Ship Your EnemiesTech Billionaire Dan O'Dowd Owns 5 Teslas.

       "  \"This week, five of the stock market’s “Magnificent Seven”—Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META)—reported financial results for the last quarter of 2023. Big Tech companies closed a year full of bold headlines: Alphabet’s YouTube reached 100 million subscribers; Microsoft launched a suite of A.I. products and finalized its acquisition of gaming behemoth Activision Blizzard; Apple debuted the iPhone 15 and released its Vision Pro VR headset (It’s available in stores today (Feb. 2)); Meta began paying its first ever cash dividend; and Amazon further expanded its e-commerce offerings and upped its game in video streaming.Here is a recap of Big Tech’s overall blowout Q4 and what their CEOs said on earnings calls.Quarterly revenue: $86.3 billion, up 13 percent from a year agoNet income: $20.69 billion, or $1.64 per shareAdvertising revenue: $65.52 billionGoogle (GOOGL)’s ad revenue for the December quarter included $48 billion from Google Search and approximately $9.2 billion from YouTube. On a call with analysts on Jan. 30, CEO Sundar Pichai touted the rapid growth of YouTube, calling it a “key driver of our subscription revenue.”The tech giant also reported the first time that YouTube had more than 100 million paid subscribers at the end of 2023. The video platform plowed in as much revenue as Google’s cloud business, which also saw strong growth in the fourth quarter.Quarterly revenue: $62 billion, up 18 percent from a year agoNet income: $21.9 billion, or $2.93 per shareCloud revenue: $33 billion, up 24 percent from a year agoMicrosoft drew headlines throughout 2023 for its many initiatives, from deepened collaboration with OpenAI to legal progress in its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. On the earnings call on Jan. 30, CEO Satya Nadella emphasized the company’s transition from experimenting with A.I. to applying the technology at scale, with A.I. capabilities being integrated across Microsoft’s product offerings, from Microsoft Copilot to Azure AI to GitHub Copilot, the popular A.I. developer tool.“We’re using this A.I. inflection point to redefine our role in business applications,” Nadella told analysts.Quarterly revenue: $119.6 billion, up 2 percent from a year agoNet income: $33.9 billion, or $2.18 per shareiPhone revenue: $69.7 billion, up 6 percent from a year agoiPhones continued to dominate Apple’s revenue makeup, accounting for roughly 60 percent of its Q4 sales. The Mac segment generated $7.8 billion in revenue, returning to growth, while iPad revenue fell 25 percent from the previous year to $7 billion. The sharp decline was in part due to Apple’s lack of new iPad models in 2023.\\xa0Apple’s revenue in the “Wearables, Home, and Accessories” business fell 11 percent year-over-year to $12 billion. This decline was offset by a 11 percent growth in the “Services” unit, which includes Apple TV+, Apple News+ and Apple One bundles. The unit reported $23.1 billion in revenue in the December quarter, a record high.\\xa0Apple reported earnings a day before its Vision Pro headset arrived in stores in the U.S. On yesterday’s earnings call, CEO Tim Cook called the Vision Pro “the most advanced personal electronics device ever. We can’t wait for people to experience the magic for themselves.”Quarterly revenue: $169.9 billion, up 14 percent from a year agoNet income: $10.6 billion, or $1.00 per sharee-Commerce revenue: $70.54 billion, up 8 percent from a year agoAWS revenue: $24.2 billion, up 13 percent from a year agoAmazon saw record user acitivites during last quarter’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping events, where customers purchased over 1 billion items on Amazon globally. In the U.S., over 500 million items were ordered from independent sellers, attracting millions of new Prime memberships. Throughout 2023, Amazon provided its fastest-ever global delivery to Prime members, delivering over 7 billion units the same or the next day.“This Q4 was a record-breaking Holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023,” CEO Andy Jassy said on the earnings call yesterday.Amazon plans to increase capital expenditures in 2024, particularly in expanding its A.I. efforts. The company just launched Rufus, an A.I.-powered shopping assistant. In addition, its recent move to display ads on Prime Video aims to leverage Amazon’s massive audience for advertising expansion. In the fourth quarter, Amazon generated $14.7 billion in ad revenue, up 26.7 percent from a year ago.Quarterly revenue: $40.1 billion, up 25 percent from a year agoNet income: $14 billion, or $5.33 per share (up 300 percent from a year ago)Meta tripled profits in the December quarter, in part thanks to aggressive cost-cutting in the previous months. The tech giant also announced its inaugural cash dividend of $0.50 per share during the earnings call yesterday.\\xa0Meta’s family of social media apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, had 3.19 billion daily active users at the end of 2023. Threads, Meta’s answer to Elon Musk’s X, had 130 million monthly active users at the end of last year. CFO Susan Li said on the earnings call Meta would no longer report Facebook-specific numbers, suggesting a shift away from its legacy social media platforms. Altogether, revenue from the total family of apps came at $39 billion during the quarter, a 24 percent increase from the previous year.\\xa0Looking into 2024, CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised significant investments in A.I. for foundational research and product development, expecting capital expenditures to be between $30 billion and $37 billion this year. “Moving forward, a major goal will be building the most popular and most advanced A.I. products and services,” Zuckerberg said on yesterday’s earnings call.Elon Musk Launched His Red Tesla Roadster Into Space 6 Years Ago—Where Is It Now?'Poor Things': See It And Hate Yourself in the MorningFacebook Turns 20: Where Are Its Five Founders Now?The Complete List of All the Stuff You Can Anonymously Ship Your EnemiesTech Billionaire Dan O'Dowd Owns 5 Teslas.

       "  \"Apple’s (AAPL) Vision Pro officially hit the market on Friday, marking the most significant product launch for the company since the Apple Watch back in 2015. But the enthusiasm for the company’s most ambitious product in years was tempered on Wall Street after Apple reported a slowdown in China sales during its fiscal first quarter.The Vision Pro is, as Apple calls it, a spatial computer. But for the average person, it’s a high-powered AR/VR headset.I originally used the Vision Pro after Apple debuted it during its WWDC event in June 2023, and again just before its Feb. 2 launch. And yes, it’s every bit as impressive as you’ve heard.But a lot is riding on the Vision Pro’s long-term success as Apple looks for its next major product platform. And with storm clouds swirling above Apple’s Cupertino headquarters, the company needs a win more than ever.Apple has been dealing with an array of difficulties throughout the first few weeks of the year, and it’s not looking any brighter going into February. But the most pressing issue the company is facing at the moment is a slowdown in sales in Greater China.Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, China has been a key catalyst in Apple’s growth story over the years as the country’s expanding middle class and a surge in smartphone sales provided fertile ground for the iPhone’s popularity to take off in the region.According to Counterpoint Research, Apple was still the bestselling smartphone brand in China in Q4 2023, capturing 20% of the market compared to local rivals Xiaomi, Huawei, and Honor, which took 16%, 15.2%, and 15.1%, respectively. But Huawei saw its year-over-year market share jump 71.1% from the year prior thanks to its new 5G smartphones, while Apple’s fell 9%.That, coupled with China’s lumbering economy, meant that Apple’s overall Greater China revenue declined from $23.9 billion in Q4 2022 to $20.8 billion in Q4 2023.According to UBS analyst David Vogt, if Apple’s market share decline is permanent and the smartphone market grows a predicted 3% in 2024, “lost share in China could pressure iPhone revenue by slightly more than $7B, a 3.5% iPhone revenue headwind and ~1.9% total company headwind.”Apple also finds itself in a tangle of regulatory problems in the European Union as it works to navigate the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). Set to go into effect this year, the DMA ensures large tech companies don’t have too much power over the broader tech ecosystem. So far, Apple has announced that it will open up its platform, allowing users in the region to install third-party app stores and giving app developers the option to offer users third-party payment options beyond Apple’s in-app payment system.But there’s a catch. If developers decide to use outside payment options, they’ll still have to fork over cash to Apple. The tech giant, however, says the charge, which amounts to a 50 euro cent fee, only applies to developers whose apps are downloaded more than 1 million times in a year. After that they’ll need to pay that charge for each subsequent download.Critics, including Spotify CEO Daniel Ek and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, have struck back at Apple with Ek calling the new rule “hostile” and Sweeney saying it’s a “devious new instance of Malicious Compliance.” The EU still has to determine if Apple’s new rules comply with the DMA.In the US, meanwhile, Apple is staring down a potential Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit. According to the New York Times, the DOJ is looking into how Apple controls its hardware and software as a means of keeping consumers locked into its ecosystem and fighting off competitors. While any lawsuit could potentially take years to wind its way through the legal system it could distract the company at a time when it’s seeking to push into a new product category.The Vision Pro serves as Apple’s next-generation computing platform. At $3,499 it’s not exactly priced to move for the typical consumer, but that doesn’t minimize its importance for the company.After years of development, the headset can’t fail. And while I’ve only been able to use it briefly across two separate roughly 30-minute sessions, it’s hard to imagine a competitor matching what Apple has to offer anytime soon.The display is the sharpest I’ve seen on an AR/VR headset, the fit is comfortable, and the interface is incredibly easy to navigate. Apple boasts an enormous library of apps for the Vision Pro, though there are notable big names missing, including Netflix and YouTube.There’s also the fact that the Vision Pro is powered by an external battery that Apple says gets two hours of battery life, which could be a turnoff for some users.I’ll dive deeper into what it’s like to use the Vision Pro when I get my hands on one for an extended period, but it’s safe to say Apple has created an incredible piece of technology. Now it needs to sell the general public on it.Just add that to the list of challenges the company will have to overcome in the year ahead.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

       "  'By Jonathan Stempel(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday said tens of millions of Apple customers can pursue a class action accusing the company of monopolizing the market for iPhone apps by banning purchases outside its App Store, leading to higher prices.U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had in March 2022 refused to certify a class action, but changed her mind after the class was narrowed to include only Apple account holders who spent $10 or more on app or in-app content.While remaining \"concerned\" that the narrowed class might include more than 10 million accounts that suffered no harm, or 7.9% of the total, Rogers said that number could be reduced and there was no fixed \"cutoff\" for denying certification.The Oakland, California-based judge also rejected Apple\\'s bid to exclude testimony it considered unreliable from two expert witnesses, including Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel McFadden, about how it may have harmed consumers.Apple, based in Cupertino, California, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mark Rifkin, a lawyer for the consumers, said he was \"extremely pleased\" and looked forward to the next phase of the 12-year-old antitrust case. He estimated that the class incurred \"billions of dollars in damages.\"Class actions can result in greater recoveries at less cost than if plaintiffs are forced to sue individually.Rogers has also overseen \"Fortnite\" videogame creator Epic Games\\' antitrust case against Apple.In Sept. 2021 she ordered Apple to loosen restrictions on where developers can seek payment from customers for their apps, but stopped short of requiring Apple to allow downloads to iPhones outside its App Store.A federal appeals court upheld much of that ruling in April 2023, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to get involved last month.The case is In re Apple iPhone Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 11-06714.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Sandra Maler)'],\n",

       "  'Lighting flashes. Thunder booms. Tech titans Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Apple, Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) are at war this week.Well, maybe it’s not that dramatic… but these members of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks have certainly been battling it out this earnings season. And investors were keen to watch the battle unfold.In their struggle for dominance, these companies have been struggling for dominance in everything from the cloud to software to artificial intelligence (AI), and more.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut in an effort to beat one another, some of these tech giants have been making some hasty decisions that have come back to affect their top and bottom lines.So, in today’s Market 360, we will dig into these tech companies’ quarterly earnings from this week. Then, I’ll share the best stock-picking system to use during this earnings season and how you can access it.Let’s get into it…Alphabet bested analysts’ expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings and sales results Tuesday evening. The company reported earnings of $1.64 per share and sales of $86.31 billion, up from earnings of $1.05 per share and revenue of $76.04 billion a year ago. Analysts were calling for earnings of $1.60 per share and $85.28 billion in sales.Digging a little deeper into the report… YouTube ad revenue came in at $9.2 billion, in line with analysts’ estimates for $9.21 billion. That’s also up by 15.7% from revenue of $7.95 billion in the same quarter a year ago.Additionally, Google Cloud revenue increased 25.6% year-over-year to $9.19 billion, besting analysts’ estimates for $8.94 billion.Alphabet’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, stated:We are pleased with the ongoing strength in Search and the growing contribution from YouTube and Cloud. Each of these is already benefiting from our AI investments and innovation. As we enter the Gemini era, the best is yet to come.Now, in case you were wondering, Pichai wasn’t referring to a horoscope. Rather, Gemini is the company’s AI language model, which launched last month. But the heart of the tech giant’s business is ad revenue. And in the company’s latest earnings report, ad revenue was up 10.9% year-over-year to $65.5 billion but missed analyst expectations of $65.8 billion.Despite beating estimates on the top and bottom lines, GOOG shares fell about 2.5% on Wednesday. Unfortunately, Wall Street couldn’t get past the missed ad revenue expectations.Microsoft released its earnings report for its second quarter in fiscal year 2024 after the closing bell on Tuesday.The company reported earnings of $2.93 per share on revenue of $62.02 billion, up from $2.35 per share and $50.12 billion. This translates to 33.2% year-over-year earnings growth and 17.6% year-over-year revenue growth. Analysts anticipated $2.77 per share earnings on revenue of $61.13 billion, so the company posted a 5.8% and a 1.5% revenue surprise.Now, one of Microsoft’s most closely watched divisions is its Intelligent Cloud platform. Cloud revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $25.9 billion. This also topped analysts’ expectations for $25.3 billion.During the earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella noted:We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we’re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.The company also provided forward-looking guidance for the second quarter. Company management anticipates revenue between $60.4 billion and $61.4 billion. Analysts had estimated second-quarter revenue of $60.9 billion.Additionally, Microsoft forecast operating expenses of $15.8 to $15.9 billion in the current quarter, up from $15.4 billion in the previous one. This, coupled with the cloudy outlook for the company, weighed on investors as they digested the news.So, even though Microsoft reported its highest profit growth in more than two years, this “light” guidance disappointed Wall Street, and the stock dropped by 2.3% on Wednesday.Amazon released its fourth-quarter earnings results Thursday evening. For Amazon’s third quarter, it reported adjusted earnings of $1.00 per share, which came in above analysts’ estimates for $0.80 per share.Revenue rose 14% year-over-year to $169.96 billion, which was above analysts’ projections for $166.26 billion. This compares to earnings of $0.03 per share and revenue of $149.2 billion in the same quarter of last year.Additionally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $24.2 billion, just above analysts’ estimates for $24.17 billion.Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, stated:This Q4 was a record-breaking Holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023 for Amazon. While we made meaningful revenue, operating income and free cash flow processes, what we’re most pleased with is the continued invention and customer experience improvements across our business.Following these stellar earnings results, shares of AMZN rose nearly 8% on Friday.Apple’s earnings came in at $2.18 per share, an all-time record for the company, which beat analysts’ estimates for $2.11 per share. It’s also up 15.9% year-over-year from earnings of $1.88 per share in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue of $119.58 billion also beat expectations of $117.9 billion, and was up 2.1% from the same quarter last year.The bright spot in Apple’s report was its Services revenue and iPhone sales. Services revenue, which includes Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness and Apple One, rose 11.3% year-over-year to $23.12 billion. Likewise, iPhone revenue came in at $69.70 billion which rose 5.9% year-over-year.During the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook stated:Today Apple is reporting revenue growth for the December quarter fueled by iPhone sales, and an all-time revenue record in Services. We are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments.Now, all of this seems very positive, but it is important to note that sales out of China were disappointing. This region, the company’s third largest after North America and Europe, reported sales of $20.8 billion while analysts were expecting $23.9 billion.This nearly 13% miss did not sit well with Wall Street. Following the report, Apple shares opened around 3.4% lower on Friday, but leveled out to end the day relatively flat.Meta Platforms announced its fourth-quarter results Thursday afternoon. Revenue increased 24.7% year-over-year to $40.11 billion and also beat Wall Street consensus estimates for revenue of $39.17 billion.Meanwhile, earnings per share surged 202.8% year-over-year to $5.33 per share, up from earnings of $1.76 per share in the same quarter of last year. Analysts were calling for earnings of $4.94 per share.Facebook daily active users rose 6% year-over-year to 2.11 billion, while Facebook monthly active users rose 3% year-over-year to 3.07 billion.Now, Meta’s Reality Labs sales passed $1 billion in the fourth quarter, but the virtual reality unit recorded $4.65 billion in losses. The company noted that they expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to ongoing product development efforts in the augmented/virtual reality space.During its earnings call, Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, stated:We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow. We’ve made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.Now, the biggest news from this earnings report is that META initiated a quarterly dividend and boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion. The company pay its first quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share on March 26. All shareholders of record on February 22 will receive the dividend.Wall Street cheered this news and META shares popped on Friday, rising nearly 22% and adding a historic $200 billion to the company’s market cap.Although Wall Street might be laser-focused on the Tech Titans’ earnings this week, I don’t want you to focus too much on these stocks alone.The reality is that more than hundred companies reported earnings this week – and we’ll hear from even more until earnings season comes to a close in late February.Now, there is a lot of data and information being thrown at investors during this time. It’s every stock for itself, and it can be overwhelming if you don’t know where to start.That’s where my Quantum Cash system comes in.At its core, Quantum Cash uses a series of AI algorithms to constantly scout massive amounts of data looking for patterns. Many of these patterns are nonlinear, meaning you’re not going to be able to see them with the naked eye. But the more data you feed it, the more patterns it can spot.This is the system I use in Accelerated Profits, and it’s what’s helped pinpoint companies that are primed to post strong earnings results.Case in point: Nine companies I recommended in Accelerated Profits reported their latest quarterly results this week. Of these nine companies, eight topped analysts’ estimates, and five rallied to new 52-week highs in the wake of their earnings reports.Clearly, earnings are working, folks. As this earnings season plays out, I expect wave-after-wave of positive earnings to continue to propel my Accelerated Profits stocks higher.To learn more about my Quantum Cash system and how I incorporate it into Accelerated Profits, click here.(Already an Accelerated Profits member?

       "  \"Meta Platforms' (META) stock rocketed higher on Friday, climbing more than 20% after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and guidance and announced new shareholder return initiatives.With Friday's rally, the company added nearly $200 billion to its market cap, a stock market record according to Bloomberg data. Meta shares were trading around $475 on Friday; at its lows in 2022, the stock fell to as low as $90.Meta's market cap now stands north of $1.2 trillion.For the fourth quarter, Meta reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.33 on revenue of $40.11 billion. Analysts were anticipating adjusted EPS of $4.94 on revenue of $39.01 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported revenue of $32.2 billion in the same quarter last year.The company also boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. In the current quarter, Meta said it anticipates revenue of between $34.6 billion and $37 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations for revenues to tally $33.6 billion.Meta's advertising revenue came in at $38.7 billion in the fourth quarter, beating expectations for $37.8 billion. The company also reported 2.11 billion Facebook daily active users. Wall Street was anticipating 2.07 billion.The company reported ad impressions rose 21% over last year during the period while the average price per ad fell 2%.Meta's Reality Labs, however, continues to be a burden on the company. The division, which is tasked with turning Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse into a reality, lost another $4.65 billion, up from the $4.3 billion the company lost on the endeavor in the same period last year. Still, the division beat expectations on revenue, topping $1.07 billion versus an anticipated $812 million.The launch of Apple’s rival Vision Pro headset could create a jump in consumer interest in AR/VR headsets and generate a knock-on effect for Meta’s Quest line of headsets.But Meta's Reality Labs efforts have taken a backseat in the minds of investors amid increased investments in generative AI. In January, Zuckerberg announced in an Instagram Reels post that the company's long-term strategy was to develop general artificial intelligence and make it open source.There's no single definition of generative AI, but broadly speaking, it’s a kind of AI that can think and learn like a human. In other words, it's capable of understanding a multitude of concepts rather than specializing in a certain field.In 2024, Meta expects its expenses to total $94 billion-$99 billion, with the company noting, among other things, that payroll costs will rise this year as it adds more staff in higher-cost, technical roles amid its push into AI features.Meta also disclosed that in 2023 restructuring charges, including severance and facilities consolidation, totaled $3.45 billion. The company's head count as of Dec. 31, 2023, stood at 67,317, down 22% over the prior year.Meta has been on a hot streak over the last 12 months, with shares rocketing 121% over that period and outperforming the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).In January, the company’s market capitalization once again eclipsed the $1 trillion mark.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

       "  \"We saw a slew of earnings this week from the market’s leading stocks, and they didn’t disappoint. In addition to many other companies that reported earnings, five of the ‘Magnificent 7’ informed us of their performance.On Tuesday, we heard from Microsoft\\xa0MSFT\\xa0and Alphabet\\xa0GOOGL, and then on Thursday afternoon from Amazon\\xa0AMZN, Apple\\xa0AAPL, and Meta Platforms\\xa0META.All these market leading companies have put up incredible stock performance over the last 18 months, and it looks like that trend may well continue. In this article we are going to take a look at the quarterly earnings reports, valuations, and Zacks Ranks, and attempt to identify which are the most attractive investments right now.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings SummariesMicrosoft: Q2 2024 saw Microsoft soar past expectations with 18% revenue growth and a 33% EPS jump. Their cloud product, Azure, fueled the gain with a 30% surge and doubled its AI integration showcasing commitment to the future. However, a lower-than-expected Q3 revenue forecast was a notable concern. Despite this, Microsoft remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its thriving cloud business and dedication to AI advancements.Alphabet: While Q4 2023 earnings for Alphabet topped EPS estimates by 2%, ad revenue missed expectations slightly, leading to a stock price dip despite an overall 14% YoY sales growth. Their cloud business continues to shine, but concerns linger about growth in the core advertising engine. With a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold), may be a bit less appealing based on earnings estimate trends.Amazon: Q4 2023 earnings were music to investors' ears with Amazon exceeding estimates on both revenue and EPS. Their cloud computing arm, AWS, continues to be a major growth driver, and advertising revenue also surpassed expectations. This positive report led to a stock price rise and solidified Amazon's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.Apple: Q1 2024 earnings saw Apple beat analyst expectations for both revenue and EPS. Revenue grew 2% YoY to $119.6 billion, and EPS increased 16% YoY to $2.18. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, Services revenue reached an all-time high, suggesting a shift towards recurring income streams. The company also achieved a record number of active devices. Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.Meta Platforms: Q4 2023 earnings surpassed expectations, leading to a more than 20% surge in stock price. Both revenue and EPS beat analyst estimates, with revenue growing 25% YoY. The company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend and a $50 billion stock buyback, further contributing to investor excitement. Metaverse investment continues, and its profitability remains a concern for some investors. META has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.Valuations The chart below shows the forward earnings multiples of each of the stocks discussed in this article. We can see that GOOGL and META have the lowest, near 20x, and AMZN has the highest at 43.5x.AAPL and MSFT are in the middle of the pack with 28.4x and 36.2x respectively.It is also worth noting that AMZN, META and GOOGL are all below their 10-year median valuations, while AAPL and MSFT are above them.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionI think Meta Platforms and Amazon are showing the most promise for further big moves ahead. Amazon’s development is just so impressive to me, with AWS still growing at 20%, and their new advertising business growing at 23% annually and suddenly bringing in $60 billion in sales annually.The success in ads is even more impressive when compared to Alphabet, the leading online ad platforms, whose growth is slowing significantly.Meta Platforms too is just absolutely killing it. Even with its 250% rally in the last year and a half it still trades at a very reasonable earnings multiple. And now with its new $50 billion buyback plan, and a new dividend, it is showing a real commitment to returning cash to shareholders.Alphabet, although it has some concerning growth data regarding its ad business does continue to chug along. I don’t think it has the best growth prospects, but there is no doubting it is the cheapest of the Magnificent 7, which makes it a worthy investment consideration.Apple and Microsoft are of course fantastic businesses that should be a part of any well diversified investment portfolio, but I think at this point in time are less appealing than the other three. Apple is seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales growth, and Microsoft seems to have a lot of future news priced in especially regarding its recent gains with AI. The premium valuations are a concern as well.Nonetheless, this group of the world’s leading companies have shown that even at their mammoth sizes, they continue to thrive. Furthermore, they are showing that the US economy is still performing at a steady rate.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
