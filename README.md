# Project Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced market sentiment analysis tool leveraging various data sources, including newsfeeds, to monitor and interpret the market dynamics for a specific cryptocurrency. The core objective is to generate regular buy/sell recommendations by analyzing the sentiment and emerging trends within the market.

## Current Phase of Development:

- **Data Collection**: Initiating the compilation of a comprehensive dataset comprising news articles, headlines, and other relevant textual content. This may extend to include social media inputs, such as tweets, to enrich the dataset.
- **Integration with APIs**: Planning to utilize APIs (e.g., Google Search API) to streamline the process of acquiring real-time news feeds and live pricing data.

## Future Goals:

- **Model Training**: The project envisions training a sophisticated model that can effectively correlate external factors, such as news sentiment and social media trends, with cryptocurrency price movements.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Incorporating historical price data to enhance the model's predictive accuracy and reliability.

This initiative is in its nascent stage, focusing on dataset accrual and the establishment of a robust framework for data processing and analysis. The ultimate aim is to create a tool that not only tracks market sentiment but also predicts potential price fluctuations based on a wide array of external factors.
